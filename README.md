# The VOD Reaction License Project

Welcome to the official repository for the VOD Reaction License project! This project provides a set of experimental, customizable license templates and accompanying guides designed for content creators (especially streamers on platforms like Twitch and YouTube) who wish to allow and encourage specific types of reuse of their VODs (past live stream recordings) by their community.

The core goal of the VOD Reaction License model is to foster a more interactive, collaborative, and respectful community environment by:
- Clearly permitting certain VOD reuse, particularly for "reaction" style content.
- Ensuring proper attribution to the original creator (the Licensor).
- Enabling dialogue and engagement through a reciprocal grant-back clause (allowing the Licensor to reuse the community's creations under similar terms).
- Providing some control over where content is shared by specifying permitted platforms.

This license model was originally conceived and drafted by **Naoki Shibata**. The drafting and refinement process for these templates and guides involved iterative conceptual exploration and textual assistance from Google's AI model, Gemini. The final structure, terms, and intent of this license model are those of Naoki Shibata.

## Available Versions

This repository is organized by version. Each version directory contains the specific license template text, a guide for streamers wishing to adopt that version of the license template ("Adopter's Guide"), and a template for a user-friendly guide for their community members ("Licensee Guide"), along with a version-specific README.

Please choose the version that best suits your needs. For most current uses, the latest stable version is recommended.

* **Version 0.1 (Stable Release)**
    * Description: Initial stable release of the VOD Reaction License.
    * **[Access Version 0.1 Files and Documentation](./v0.1/README.md)**

* **Version 0.2 (Work in Progress)**
    * Description: This version is currently under development. Terms and documents may be unstable, incomplete, or subject to significant change. Use with caution or for testing and feedback purposes only.
    * **[Access Version 0.2 (WIP) Files and Documentation](./v0.2/README.md)**

## How This Repository is Organized

* Each major version of the license and its associated documents is contained within its own directory (e.g., `/v0.1/`, `/v0.2/`).
* Inside each version directory, you will typically find:
    * `VOD_REACTION_LICENSE.md`: The customizable license template text for that version.
    * `GUIDE_FOR_ADOPTERS.md`: A guide for streamers who wish to adopt that version of the license template for their own VODs.
    * `GUIDE_FOR_LICENSEES.md`: A template for a user-friendly guide that adopting streamers can customize for their own community members.
    * `README.md`: A README specific to that version, detailing its features, changes (if any from previous versions), and status.

## Licensing of Repository Content

* **License Template Texts (e.g., `VOD_REACTION_LICENSE.md`):** The distribution and modification terms for the VOD Reaction License *template text itself* are specified within Section 11 of each version of the license template document. Generally, this allows for verbatim copying and modification only of designated placeholders if you wish to use the "VOD Reaction License Version X.Y" name.
* **Guide Documents and Other General Project Files:** Unless otherwise specified, this top-level README.md, the Adopter's Guides, and the Licensee Guide templates within this repository are made available under the **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License (CC BY-SA 4.0)**. You are free to share and adapt these specific guide documents for your own purposes, provided you adhere to the terms of the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.
