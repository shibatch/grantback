## VOD Reaction License \- A Community Licensing Model for Streamers

This project provides a template for a custom license designed to facilitate content reuse, particularly "reaction" style content, among streamers on popular video sharing and streaming platforms such as Twitch and YouTube.  

The "VOD Reaction License Version 0.3" is an experimental, custom license that allows content creators (Licensors) to grant specific permissions to their community (Licensees) to reuse designated VODs.  

Key features include:  

* Permission for Reuse: Clearly grants rights to create derivative works (like reaction videos, compilations, reviews) from the Licensor's VODs.  
* Platform Limitation: Reuse by Licensees is restricted to specific platforms designated by the adopting Licensor (the template provides Twitch and YouTube as primary examples).  
* Attribution: Requires Licensees to provide clear attribution to the original Licensor.  
* Grant-Back Clause: Licensees grant back a license to the original Licensor to reuse the new "Derivative Work" created by the Licensee, under symmetrical conditions (platform limitation and attribution back to the Licensee). This fosters dialogue and allows Licensors to engage with community creations.  
* Community Focused: Aims to encourage interaction, collaboration, and mutual promotion within the streaming community.

This License Template was originally conceived and drafted by [Naoki Shibata](https://github.com/shibatch/). The drafting and refinement process for this template and its accompanying guides involved iterative conceptual exploration and textual assistance from Google's AI model, Gemini. The final structure, terms, and intent of this license model are those of Naoki Shibata.  


### Why This License Model?

The creation of this license model was motivated by several observations and goals common in the streaming world:

1. Popularity of Reaction Content: Reaction-style content is a major way streamers engage with each other's material and communities.  
2. Copyright Clarity: Simply reacting to content doesn't automatically grant the necessary rights. This license aims to provide a clear permission pathway.  
3. Supporting Growth: For many streamers (especially those building their audience), having their content reacted to by others can significantly boost visibility and engagement. This license is designed to actively encourage such interactions.  
4. Enabling Dialogue and Response: The grant-back feature ensures that the original Licensor can respond to, feature, or otherwise engage with reactions to their content, which is particularly useful for addressing misleading or bad-faith reactions and fostering a balanced conversation.  
5. Controlled Sharing: By allowing Licensors to designate specific Permitted Platforms (such as Twitch and YouTube) for reuse, they can better manage the spread of their content beyond their desired ecosystems.
6. Flexibility for Corporate or Agency Guidelines: The license is adaptable to specific reuse guidelines set by a company or agency a licensor may be affiliated with. The license template provides a dedicated section where the licensor can add their own custom rules—such as prohibiting commercial use or restricting use with certain types of content—to align with corporate policies.

<summary>Relationship Between This License Model and the Hosseinzadeh v. Klein Case</summary>
&nbsp;  

To understand the background of this license model, the landmark U.S. copyright case Hosseinzadeh v. Klein (the h3h3Productions case) serves as a helpful reference. In this case, a court ruled that a critical commentary video on YouTube (a "reaction video") did not infringe on the original work's copyright and was protected by the U.S. doctrine of "fair use".

While this ruling was a significant victory for creators of reaction videos, its scope is limited. Judge Katherine B. Forrest, who delivered the judgment, made a clear distinction between critical commentary, like the Kleins' video, and a mere "group watching session without comment," cautioning that not all reaction videos would qualify as fair use. Furthermore, YouTube's own official policy states that the final determination of whether a use is fair is made by a court of law, not the platform.

This means that creators who rely on "fair use" always face the following uncertainties:

* The ambiguity of whether their video will be legally recognized as "transformative" criticism.
* The fact that the platform will not necessarily protect them from a copyright infringement claim.
* The need to be prepared for a potentially expensive legal battle to ultimately prove fair use in court.

The VOD Reaction License offers a clear solution to these problems.

This license eliminates the need for community creators (Licensees) to guess whether their content qualifies as fair use and to bear the associated legal risks. This is because the license provides explicit, upfront permission from the original creator (Licensor) to create derivative works like reaction videos.

Furthermore, this license features a Grant-Back clause, which is not found in the fair use doctrine. This clause allows the Licensor to reuse the Licensee's derivative work, which encourages a two-way dialogue and activates the entire community, moving beyond one-sided content use.

In addition, it is important to note that the concept of fair use itself is fundamentally specific to the U.S. legal system. Legal systems vary significantly from country to country; for example, Canada, the EU, and Japan—which has no general fair use provision—all have different laws. For creators who operate globally, this legal diversity is a source of further uncertainty.

The VOD Reaction License is designed to overcome these differences in national laws and provide a consistent, collaborative framework that allows creators to produce content with peace of mind.

### How to Use This License Model

For Viewers/Creators (Potential Licensees of a Streamer's VODs):

If a streamer indicates that their VODs are available under a "VOD Reaction License," look for a link on their channel (e.g., in their "About" section, video descriptions, or a pinned post) to their specific version of the license text and any accompanying usage guide they provide. Read those carefully to understand the terms they are offering.

For Streamers Wanting to Adopt This License Model for Their Own VODs (Adopting Licensors):

1. Read the [GUIDE\_FOR\_ADOPTERS.md](GUIDE_FOR_ADOPTERS.md) in this repository carefully. This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to adapt and implement this license model.  
2. Customize the Template: Copy the [VOD\_REACTION\_LICENSE.md](VOD_REACTION_LICENSE.md) template and fill in all the bracketed placeholders \[Placeholder\_Name\] with your specific channel information.  
3. Host Your License: Publish your customized version of the license text on a publicly accessible platform (e.g., your own GitHub repository, a personal website, or a GitHub Gist).  
4. Inform Your Community: Clearly state on your channel(s) that your designated VODs are offered under your instance of the "VOD Reaction License Version 0.3" and provide a direct link to your hosted version of the license.  
5. Provide Guidance: It is highly recommended to also provide a version of the [GUIDE\_FOR\_LICENSEES.md](GUIDE_FOR_LICENSEES.md), customized for your channel, to help your community understand how they can reuse your content.

A Note on VODs in Documentation: While this README and the guides often discuss VODs in the context of live stream recordings (due to the license's origins and common streamer use-cases), the VOD Reaction License text itself defines "VODs" more broadly. For the precise definition, please always refer to the actual license document.

### A Note on Minors and Legal Capacity

This VOD Reaction License, like any agreement, is subject to applicable laws regarding an individual's legal capacity to be bound by its terms. In the United States, for example, individuals are generally considered minors until they reach the age of 18 (though this can vary by state for specific purposes). Agreements entered into by minors may not be legally binding on them or might be voidable at their option under state law.

If you are a minor considering using VODs under this license, or offering your VODs under this license, it is strongly recommended to involve a parent or legal guardian. Similarly, if you are a Licensor adopting this license for a community that may include minors, or a Licensee interacting with content from a minor Licensor, awareness of these legal principles is important. Minors should typically seek consent and guidance from a parent or legal guardian before agreeing to terms that have legal implications.
