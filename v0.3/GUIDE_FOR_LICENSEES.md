Reusing VODs from **\[Licensor's Primary Channel Name\]** under the VOD Reaction License (Usage Guide for Licensees)

1\. Introduction: Welcome\!

This guide explains the main steps and important points for reusing VODs from **\[Licensor's Primary Channel Name\]** (hereinafter "Licensor," "we," or "us") to create and publish new content (hereinafter "Derivative Work") under our "VOD Reaction License Version 0.3" (hereinafter "the License").

The purpose of our License is to enable you, fellow creators (hereinafter "Licensee" or "You"), to use our VODs to create new videos, particularly reaction content, on the "Permitted Platforms" (as defined in the full License text provided by **\[Licensor's Primary Channel Name\]**), and to foster creative and constructive interaction within our shared community.

This guide is intended to aid your understanding. The full License text is the legally binding document that governs your use. Please ensure you review the full License text carefully.

2\. Creating Your Content: A Step-by-Step Guide

Under this License, You can create and distribute new videos (Derivative Works) using our VODs. We particularly envision the creation of reaction content. Here’s how:

Step 2.1: Identifying Permitted VODs

VODs covered by this License are those indicated by us (the Licensor). You can find them **\[Licensor to describe how: e.g., "in the 'VODs for Reaction' playlist on our YouTube channel: \[Link to Playlist\]," or "if a video description explicitly states 'This VOD is available under the VOD Reaction License'," or "all public VODs on our channel at \[Channel Link\] unless specifically marked otherwise," etc.\]**. If unsure, please ask\!

Step 2.2: Core Requirements for Your New Work (Derivative Work)

* Your created Derivative Work may only be published on the Permitted Platforms (as defined in the full License text from **\[Licensor's Primary Channel Name\]**).  
* Attribution to us (the Licensor) is required in each Derivative Work you create.
* Note on Uploading to YouTube: If YouTube is a Permitted Platform and you upload Your Derivative Work there, you should select the "Standard YouTube License" for your video. This selection is compatible with your obligations under this VOD Reaction License. The VOD Reaction License specifically governs your permission to use our VOD and the grant-back license you provide to us for Your Derivative Work.

Step 2.3: How to Provide Attribution to "**\[Licensor's Designated Channel Name for Attribution\]**"

You are required to provide attribution to us, the Licensor, in one of the following ways for each Derivative Work:

* Visual Display: Clearly display the name "**\[Licensor's Designated Channel Name for Attribution\]**" in a viewer-friendly manner somewhere in the video component of Your Derivative Work (e.g., as an on-screen overlay for a reasonable duration, in Your start or end credits, or in the video description).  
  * *Example text:* Original VOD by: **\[Licensor's Designated Channel Name for Attribution\]**  
* Audible Mention: Clearly announce our designated channel name in the audio component of Your Derivative Work.  
  * *Example phrase:* "This segment features a reaction to a VOD from the channel **\[Licensor's Designated Channel Name for Attribution\]**." or "Original VOD content by **\[Licensor's Designated Channel Name for Attribution\]**."

Step 2.4: IMPORTANT – Managing Copyright and Preparing Your Derivative Work for Grant-Back

When you create your Derivative Work, you are making a new piece of content. It's crucial to respect copyright, both for the Licensor's VODs and any other materials you might use. This license has specific terms regarding this:

A. Regarding Third-Party Content *within the Licensor's VODs* (see License Clause 5):

* The license we (the Licensor) grant you for our VODs covers *our original content* within those VODs.  
* Our license to you does not automatically grant you the right to reuse any third-party copyrighted material that might be incidentally included in our VODs (e.g., in-game music that the game publisher doesn't allow for reuse in your new work, music we played on stream under a license personal to us, clips from other creators we might have shown).  
* Your Responsibility: If you choose to include portions of our VODs that contain such third-party material in your Derivative Work, *you* are solely responsible for:  
  1. Identifying that third-party content.  
  2. Determining if your intended use of it is permissible (e.g., under fair use doctrines or other legal exceptions relevant to your situation, or because you obtain your own license for it).  
  3. Obtaining any necessary permissions directly from the rights holders of that third-party content if your use requires it.  
* We (the Licensor) make no warranties that all third-party content within our VODs is cleared for your specific reuse.

B. Preparing the "Provided Copy" of Your Derivative Work for Our Grant-Back Reuse (Corresponds to the License Sections 3.d and 4.e.iv):

When you provide us with a copy of your Derivative Work for our grant-back reuse (the "Provided Copy" mentioned in Section 3.d of the License), our main goal is that we can reuse it smoothly and legally. Here’s a step-by-step way to think about preparing this copy:

1. Be Mindful of Copyright from the Start (Ideal Scenario for Your Published Version):
Ideally, when you are first creating and editing your publicly available video (the "Published Version"), try to be mindful of any third-party copyrighted material you include (like background music, other video clips, game audio that might need clearance, etc.). If your Published Version is already "clean" – or the key parts reacting to our VOD are clean – preparing the Provided Copy for us will be much simpler. This is the best approach.

2. Isolate Key Segments for the Provided Copy (Basic Method):
Often, your full Published Version (e.g., a long stream recording) will contain various segments. A common and straightforward way to prepare the core of the Provided Copy for us is to edit your Published Version to isolate the main segment(s) where you directly engage with our VOD. This typically means:
   * All parts where our VOD is actually shown or heard.
   * Your direct reactions, commentary, and discussion that occur while or immediately around the use of our VOD. Let's call this focused selection the "Primary Reaction Segment." The VOD Reaction License (Section 3.d(i)) legally requires that, at a minimum, all parts of your Published Version where our VOD is shown or heard must be completely included in the Provided Copy. Isolating the Primary Reaction Segment as described here is a good way to ensure you meet this core requirement.

3. Ensure the Primary Reaction Segment is "Clean" (Applying rules from Section 3.d of the License if copyrighted material was included):
Now, review the Primary Reaction Segment you've isolated.
   * If it's already "clean" (hopefully because you were mindful during your initial creation, as mentioned in step 1): Excellent! This can form the basis of your Provided Copy.
   * If it still contains uncleared third-party copyrighted material (e.g., background music you don't have the rights to for this reuse, uncleared game audio): You will need to edit this segment further to make it "clean" before providing it to us. The License (Section 3.d(ii)) is very specific about these edits:
      * They must be strictly limited to the minimum objectively necessary to remove or replace that uncleared third-party material.
      * No other creative or stylistic changes should be made to the content or presentation of your Primary Reaction Segment as it appeared in your Published Version. (For example, this is not the opportunity to cut your own speech for brevity, change your opinions, or re-edit the flow of your reaction, unless those changes are a direct and unavoidable part of the copyright clearance itself).
   * If Your Speech or Other Important Original Content is Lost During Cleaning: If these essential copyright-clearing edits (like muting a section with background music that also contained your speech) unavoidably cause your own important original content within the Primary Reaction Segment to be lost or obscured, the License (Section 3.d(iii)) requires you to inform us of what was lost. A practical way to do this is to provide a simple text file with the Provided Copy, noting, for example: "Segment from [timestamp] to [timestamp] was muted due to background music. During this time, my speech was: '[Your lost speec]'."

4. Consider Including Your Broader Reactions (Highly Recommended for Community Spirit!):
The License (Section 3.d(i)) legally requires the Provided Copy to include segments where our VOD is directly used. However, your overall engagement with our VOD might be much broader and equally interesting! For example:
   * You might have an introductory discussion about our VOD before you show it.
   * You might share your overall thoughts and conclusions for several minutes after the direct VOD feature.
   * You might even try out a game technique from our VOD in your own gameplay after the main VOD feature (even if our VOD isn't continuously on screen during your gameplay test). While these broader segments are not strictly required by Section 3.d(i) of the License to be in the Provided Copy (unless our VOD itself is being shown/heard within them), we strongly encourage you to also prepare and include these kinds of related reaction segments if you're happy to share them for our grant-back reuse. Of course, these additional segments would also need to be "clean" of any third-party copyright issues for which you cannot grant us reuse rights. Sharing your fuller reaction helps us understand your perspective completely and enriches our ability to interact with your creative work, fostering a better community dialogue! This is a friendly recommendation, not a strict legal requirement from the License for the composition of the Provided Copy beyond the "Primary Reaction Segment" described in step 2.

5. Final Check for Overall "Cleanness":
Remember, the License (Section 4.e.iv) requires that the entire Provided Copy you ultimately give us must be "clean" – meaning you have all necessary rights for all its components, allowing us to reuse it under the grant-back terms.


Step 2.5: Reporting Your Derivative Work to Us (License Clause 3.c)

After publishing Your Derivative Work, You must promptly notify us (the Licensor) of its publication in a reasonable manner.

* **\[Licensor to specify preferred notification method(s) here. E.g., "Please notify us by tagging @\[Licensor'sSocialMediaHandle\] on X/Twitter when you post your video," or "Send a link to your Derivative Work to \[licensor-contact-email@example.com\]," or "Mention us in the YouTube upload using @\[LicensorYouTubeChannel\]."\]**


Step 2.6: Providing a Copy of Your Derivative Work if Requested (Corresponds to Section 3.d of the License)

If we (the Licensor) request a digital copy of your Derivative Work after you've published it, the VOD Reaction License (in its Section 3.d) outlines specific legal requirements for this copy. This is especially important if the copy is intended for our grant-back reuse (which the License calls the "Provided Copy").

We strongly advise you to carefully review Section 3.d of the License. In essence, it details:

   * Exactly which parts of your publicly available video (the "Published Version") must be included in the copy you provide to us.
   * Strict limitations on how those parts can be edited (changes are only for essential third-party copyright clearance when compared to how they appeared in your Published Version).
   * Your obligation to notify us if your important original content (like speech) within those parts is unavoidably lost during such cleaning.

Section 2.4.B of this guide provides a step-by-step approach and practical advice for preparing this Provided Copy in line with these requirements from the License. Remember, the copy should be in a common digital format and delivered via a reasonable method, as also stated in Section 3.d of the License. (The "Excusable Non-Performance" clause in Section 9 of the License applies to this obligation if extreme circumstances prevent you from providing the copy).

Providing this copy helps us engage with your work and potentially feature it under the grant-back terms.


3\. The Grant-Back to \[**Licensor's Primary Channel Name\]**: A Brief Explanation (License Clause 4\)

When You create and publish a Derivative Work under this License using our VODs, You are also granting us (**\[Licensor's Primary Channel Name\]**, the Licensor) specific rights to reuse Your Derivative Work.  
When we reuse Your Derivative Work, we (the Licensor) will also adhere to the terms of this License:

* We will only use Your Derivative Work on the Permitted Platforms (as defined in our License).  
* We will provide attribution to Your channel. (Please inform us of Your preferred channel name for this attribution if it's different from the one primarily associated with Your Derivative Work, for example, when You notify us about Your publication as per Step 2.5).
