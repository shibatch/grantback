Reusing VODs from **\[Licensor's Primary Channel Name\]** under the VOD Reaction License (Usage Guide for Licensees)

1\. Introduction: Welcome\!

This guide explains the main steps and important points for reusing VODs from **\[Licensor's Primary Channel Name\]** (hereinafter "Licensor," "we," or "us") to create and publish new content (hereinafter "Streamed Work") under our "VOD Reaction License Version 0.2" (hereinafter "the License").

The purpose of our License is to enable you, fellow creators (hereinafter "Licensee" or "You"), to use our VODs to create new videos, particularly reaction content, on the "Permitted Platforms" (as defined in the full License text provided by **\[Licensor's Primary Channel Name\]**), and to foster creative and constructive interaction within our shared community.

This guide is intended to aid your understanding. The full License text is the legally binding document that governs your use. Please ensure you review the full License text carefully.

2\. Creating Your Content: A Step-by-Step Guide

Under this License, You can create and distribute new videos (Streamed Works) using our VODs. We particularly envision the creation of reaction content. Here’s how:

Step 2.1: Identifying Permitted VODs

VODs covered by this License are those indicated by us (the Licensor). You can find them **\[Licensor to describe how: e.g., "in the 'VODs for Reaction' playlist on our YouTube channel: \[Link to Playlist\]," or "if a video description explicitly states 'This VOD is available under the VOD Reaction License'," or "all public VODs on our channel at \[Channel Link\] unless specifically marked otherwise," etc.\]**. If unsure, please ask\!

Step 2.2: Core Requirements for Your New Work (Streamed Work)

* Your created Streamed Work may only be published on the Permitted Platforms (as defined in the full License text from **\[Licensor's Primary Channel Name\]**).  
* Attribution to us (the Licensor) is required in each Streamed Work you create.

Step 2.3: How to Provide Attribution to "**\[Licensor's Designated Channel Name for Attribution\]**"

You are required to provide attribution to us, the Licensor, in one of the following ways for each Streamed Work:

* Visual Display: Clearly display the name "**\[Licensor's Designated Channel Name for Attribution\]**" in a viewer-friendly manner somewhere in the video component of Your Streamed Work (e.g., as an on-screen overlay for a reasonable duration, in Your start or end credits, or in the video description).  
  * *Example text:* Original VOD by: **\[Licensor's Designated Channel Name for Attribution\]**  
* Audible Mention: Clearly announce our designated channel name in the audio component of Your Streamed Work.  
  * *Example phrase:* "This segment features a reaction to a VOD from the channel **\[Licensor's Designated Channel Name for Attribution\]**." or "Original VOD content by **\[Licensor's Designated Channel Name for Attribution\]**."

Step 2.4: IMPORTANT \- Managing Copyright for Third-Party Materials (Relates to License Clauses 4.e.iv and 5\)

When you create your Streamed Work, you are making a new piece of content. It's crucial to respect copyright, both for the Licensor's VODs and any other materials you might use. This license has specific terms regarding this:

A. Regarding Third-Party Content *within the Licensor's VODs* (see License Clause 5):

* The license we (the Licensor) grant you for our VODs covers *our original content* within those VODs.  
* Our license to you does not automatically grant you the right to reuse any third-party copyrighted material that might be incidentally included in our VODs (e.g., in-game music that the game publisher doesn't allow for reuse in your new work, music we played on stream under a license personal to us, clips from other creators we might have shown).  
* Your Responsibility: If you choose to include portions of our VODs that contain such third-party material in your Streamed Work, *you* are solely responsible for:  
  1. Identifying that third-party content.  
  2. Determining if your intended use of it is permissible (e.g., under fair use doctrines or other legal exceptions relevant to your situation, or because you obtain your own license for it).  
  3. Obtaining any necessary permissions directly from the rights holders of that third-party content if your use requires it.  
* We (the Licensor) make no warranties that all third-party content within our VODs is cleared for your specific reuse.

B. Regarding Third-Party Content *You Add to Your Streamed Work* (for the Grant-Back, see License Clause 4.e.iv):

* As part of this License, when you publish your Streamed Work, you grant us (the Licensor) a license back to reuse your Streamed Work on our channels on the Permitted Platforms, with attribution to you.  
* Your Responsibility for "Clean" Content for Grant-Back: For us (the Licensor) to reuse Your Streamed Work smoothly and legally under the grant-back, the version You provide or make available to us must be "clean." This means You must have obtained all necessary rights for *all* components of Your Streamed Work (including any third-party music, clips, images, sound effects, etc., that *You* incorporated) to allow us (the Licensor) to also reuse them as part of Your Streamed Work on the Permitted Platforms.  
* To help manage this "clean content" responsibility, this License anticipates a common approach: if your original broadcast or recording session included segments distinct from your reaction to our VOD (e.g., unrelated gameplay, different discussion topics), it is assumed that when you publish your VOD of the "Streamed Work", you will separate the reaction portion (which uses our VOD) from these other segments. For instance, you might edit your full session to publish only the reaction segment as the "Streamed Work" under this License. By doing so, only the reaction segment becomes the "Streamed Work" subject to the grant-back, and rights clearance for the other, unrelated parts of your original recording is not required for the purpose of our reuse under the grant-back.  
* Therefore, when creating, editing, and publishing Your Streamed Work, You must:  
  1. Ensure Your own original contributions (commentary, video, graphics, etc.) do not infringe on any third-party rights.  
  2. For any *additional* third-party materials You choose to include in Your Streamed Work (e.g., background music for Your commentary, other video clips for illustration or humor, images, sound effects not from our VODs):  
     * You must ensure you have a license for these materials that allows not only Your use but also allows You to *sublicense or pass on the rights* for us (the Licensor) to reuse them as part of Your Streamed Work on the Permitted Platforms. Using royalty-free materials or content licensed under terms like Creative Commons (e.g., CC BY, CC0) for which you can grant these further permissions is highly encouraged for these additions.  
     * If You use third-party materials under a limited license (e.g., only for Your personal, non-sublicensable use), You must edit out these materials from the version of Your Streamed Work that You publish under this License and which is subject to the grant-back to us.  
  3. The core of Your Streamed Work being granted back should primarily be Your reaction to our VOD, using materials that are clear for this reciprocal reuse.

Step 2.5: Reporting Your Streamed Work to Us (License Clause 3.c)

After publishing Your Streamed Work, You must promptly notify us (the Licensor) of its publication in a reasonable manner.

* **\[Licensor to specify preferred notification method(s) here. E.g., "Please notify us by tagging @\[Licensor'sSocialMediaHandle\] on X/Twitter when you post your video," or "Send a link to your Streamed Work to \[licensor-contact-email@example.com\]," or "Mention us in the YouTube upload using @\[LicensorYouTubeChannel\]."\]**

Step 2.6: Providing a Copy of Your Streamed Work if Requested (License Clause 3.d)

After You have published Your Streamed Work, we (the Licensor) may request a digital copy of the relevant portions of Your Streamed Work that incorporate our VODs. If we make such a request, You are, in principle, required to promptly provide this copy to us in a common digital format and via a reasonable delivery method; however, this obligation is exceptionally excused if your specific situation meets the criteria for "Excusable Non-Performance" as detailed in Section 9 of the full License text. (Please note: The full License text, in Section 9 "Excusable Non-Performance," includes provisions for situations where You might be unable to fulfill this obligation due to circumstances genuinely beyond Your reasonable control and without Your fault or negligence.)

This obligation helps us to be aware of Your creation and allows us to potentially exercise our rights to feature Your work under the Grant-Back terms (see Section 3 of this guide and Clause 4 of the full License).  


3\. The Grant-Back to \[**Licensor's Primary Channel Name\]**: A Brief Explanation (License Clause 4\)

When You create and publish a Streamed Work under this License using our VODs, You are also granting us (**\[Licensor's Primary Channel Name\]**, the Licensor) specific rights to reuse Your Streamed Work.  
When we reuse Your Streamed Work, we (the Licensor) will also adhere to the terms of this License:

* We will only use Your Streamed Work on the Permitted Platforms (as defined in our License).  
* We will provide attribution to Your channel. (Please inform us of Your preferred channel name for this attribution if it's different from the one primarily associated with Your Streamed Work, for example, when You notify us about Your publication as per Step 2.5).

This reciprocal arrangement is a core principle of this License, designed to encourage mutual sharing and promotion within our community. For full details, please see Section 4 of the VOD Reaction License.
