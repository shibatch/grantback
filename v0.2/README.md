## VOD Reaction License \- A Community Licensing Model for Streamers

This project provides a template for a custom license designed to facilitate content reuse, particularly "reaction" style content, among streamers on popular video sharing and streaming platforms such as Twitch and YouTube.

The "VOD Reaction License Version 0.2" is an experimental, custom license that allows content creators (Licensors) to grant specific permissions to their community (Licensees) to reuse designated VODs (past live stream recordings). Key features include:

* Permission for Reuse: Clearly grants rights to create derivative works (like reaction videos, compilations, reviews) from the Licensor's VODs.  
* Platform Limitation: Reuse by Licensees is restricted to specific platforms designated by the adopting Licensor (the template provides Twitch and YouTube as primary examples).  
* Attribution: Requires Licensees to provide clear attribution to the original Licensor.  
* Grant-Back Clause: Licensees grant back a license to the original Licensor to reuse the new "Streamed Work" created by the Licensee, under symmetrical conditions (platform limitation and attribution back to the Licensee). This fosters dialogue and allows Licensors to engage with community creations.  
* Community Focused: Aims to encourage interaction, collaboration, and mutual promotion within the streaming community.

This License Template was originally conceived and drafted by [Naoki Shibata](https://github.com/shibatch/). The drafting and refinement process for this template and its accompanying guides involved iterative conceptual exploration and textual assistance from Google's AI model, Gemini. The final structure, terms, and intent of this license model are those of Naoki Shibata.

### Why This License Model?

The creation of this license model was motivated by several observations and goals common in the streaming world:

1. Popularity of Reaction Content: Reaction-style content is a major way streamers engage with each other's material and communities.  
2. Copyright Clarity: Simply reacting to content doesn't automatically grant the necessary rights. This license aims to provide a clear permission pathway.  
3. Supporting Growth: For many streamers (especially those building their audience), having their content reacted to by others can significantly boost visibility and engagement. This license is designed to actively encourage such interactions.  
4. Enabling Dialogue and Response: The grant-back feature ensures that the original Licensor can respond to, feature, or otherwise engage with reactions to their content, which is particularly useful for addressing misleading or bad-faith reactions and fostering a balanced conversation.  
5. Controlled Sharing: By allowing Licensors to designate specific Permitted Platforms (such as Twitch and YouTube) for reuse, they can better manage the spread of their content beyond their desired ecosystems.

* [GUIDE\_FOR\_ADOPTERS.md](GUIDE_FOR_ADOPTERS.md): A guide for streamers who wish to adopt this VOD Reaction License model for their own channel's VODs. It explains how to customize and implement the license template.
* [GUIDE\_FOR\_LICENSEES.md](GUIDE_FOR_LICENSEES.md): A user-friendly guide for viewers and content creators who want to reuse VODs from a streamer who has adopted this license. It explains how to do so under the terms set by that streamer. (Adopting Licensors should adapt this guide for their own community).  

### How to Use This License Model

For Viewers/Creators (Potential Licensees of a Streamer's VODs):

If a streamer indicates that their VODs are available under a "VOD Reaction License," look for a link on their channel (e.g., in their "About" section, video descriptions, or a pinned post) to their specific version of the license text and any accompanying usage guide they provide. Read those carefully to understand the terms they are offering.

For Streamers Wanting to Adopt This License Model for Their Own VODs (Adopting Licensors):

1. Read the [GUIDE\_FOR\_ADOPTERS.md](GUIDE_FOR_ADOPTERS.md) in this repository carefully. This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to adapt and implement this license model.  
2. Customize the Template: Copy the [VOD\_REACTION\_LICENSE.md](VOD_REACTION_LICENSE.md) template and fill in all the bracketed placeholders \[Placeholder\_Name\] with your specific channel information.  
3. Host Your License: Publish your customized version of the license text on a publicly accessible platform (e.g., your own GitHub repository, a personal website, or a GitHub Gist).  
4. Inform Your Community: Clearly state on your channel(s) that your designated VODs are offered under your instance of the "VOD Reaction License Version 0.2" and provide a direct link to your hosted version of the license.  
5. Provide Guidance: It is highly recommended to also provide a version of the [GUIDE\_FOR\_LICENSEES.md](GUIDE_FOR_LICENSEES.md), customized for your channel, to help your community understand how they can reuse your content.

### A Note on Minors and Legal Capacity

This VOD Reaction License, like any agreement, is subject to applicable laws regarding an individual's legal capacity to be bound by its terms. In the United States, for example, individuals are generally considered minors until they reach the age of 18 (though this can vary by state for specific purposes). Agreements entered into by minors may not be legally binding on them or might be voidable at their option under state law.

If you are a minor considering using VODs under this license, or offering your VODs under this license, it is strongly recommended to involve a parent or legal guardian. Similarly, if you are a Licensor adopting this license for a community that may include minors, or a Licensee interacting with content from a minor Licensor, awareness of these legal principles is important. Minors should typically seek consent and guidance from a parent or legal guardian before agreeing to terms that have legal implications.
