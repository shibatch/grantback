Guide for Streamers: Adopting and Using the VOD Reaction License Template

1\. Introduction: What is the VOD Reaction License and Why Use It?

Welcome\! This guide is for streamers interested in using the "VOD Reaction License Version 0.1.1" template (hereinafter "the License Template") to license their own VODs (past public live stream recordings) for reuse by their community.  
The VOD Reaction License model is designed to foster a more interactive and collaborative streaming community. Its core purposes and benefits include:

* Encouraging Community Content: By clearly stating terms for reuse, you make it easier for viewers and other creators to make reaction content, compilations, reviews, or other derivative works ("Streamed Works") using your VODs.  
* Increasing Your Visibility: Especially for growing channels, having others react to or feature your content can introduce your work to new audiences.  
* Facilitating Dialogue (The Grant-Back Feature): A key feature is the "grant-back" clause. When someone creates a Streamed Work from your VODs, they grant you a license to reuse *their* Streamed Work. This allows you to "react to their reaction," engage directly with community content, or address any points raised.  
* Maintaining Some Control: The license restricts reuse to specific platforms (Twitch and YouTube by default) and requires clear attribution to your original VODs, helping you manage how your content is shared and acknowledged.

This License Template is a custom-designed license. We believe it offers a unique way to engage with your community. It's important to understand its terms and how to implement it correctly for your channel. The text of this License Template itself is offered with specific permissions regarding its copying and modification: you can copy and distribute it, and you can adapt it for your own use by filling in the designated placeholders. However, to maintain consistency for the "VOD Reaction License Version 0.1.1" model, modifications to the core legal terms (beyond placeholders) mean your version should be considered a new, distinct license. Full details on how you can use and adapt the license template text are provided in Section 11 of the License Template document itself, and further explained in Section 6 of this guide.

2\. How to Adopt This License for Your Channel: Step-by-Step

If you wish to use this license model for your VODs, you will be offering your own version of this license to your viewers. Here’s how:

Step 2.1: Obtain the License Template Text

* You can find the master text for the "VOD Reaction License Version 0.1.1" template here: [https://github.com/shibatch/grantback/blob/main/VOD\_REACTION\_LICENSE\_V0.1.1.md](https://github.com/shibatch/grantback/blob/main/VOD_REACTION_LICENSE_V0.1.1.md)

Step 2.2: Customize the Placeholders in Your Copy

* Copy the full License Template text.  
* Carefully find and replace all bracketed placeholders \[...\] with your own specific information. These include:  
  * \[Licensor's Primary Channel Name\]: Your main channel name (e.g., "YourStreamChannel"). This will appear in the Preamble, Definition 1.a, and Section 11 (of the VOD Reaction License text, referring to "Distribution and Modification of This License Document").  
  * \[Year\] and \[Licensor's Name or Channel Name / Operator\] (in the Copyright notice section of the License Template): The current year and your legal name, channel name, or operating entity name.  
    * (A Note on Your Copyright Line): The format Copyright (c) \[Year\] \[Your Name/Entity\] is common. For content like your VODs, you might also choose to state, for example: "Copyright (c) \[Year\] \[Your Channel Name\]. My VODs under this license are offered via the VOD Reaction License Version 0.1.1." The phrase "All rights reserved." (often seen with software) is generally optional for content, as your rights are reserved by copyright law anyway, and Section 5 of the License Template ("Reservation of Rights") already clarifies this. Select a style that you are comfortable with for your channel.  
  * \[Licensor's Designated Channel Name for Attribution\] (in Definition 1.f and Section 3.b of the License Template): The specific channel name you want *your* Licensees (your VOD reusers) to credit when they use your VODs.  
  * Important Considerations When Choosing/Adding Permitted Platforms:  
    * Original Context of the License Template: This License Template was primarily written with Twitch and YouTube in mind as common distribution platforms for Streamed Works, due to their widespread use and features.  
    * Your Choice and Responsibility: As the Licensor adopting this template, you have the flexibility to designate other platforms. However, the responsibility for this choice rests entirely with you.  
    * If you add platforms beyond or instead of Twitch and YouTube, you MUST confirm the following:  
      * Functional Compatibility with this License: The platform must genuinely support the core mechanisms and spirit of the VOD Reaction License. Key functionalities to verify include:  
        * The platform's general ability to host and publicly display video content.  
        * Clear and practical ways for Licensees to provide Attribution to you (as required by Clause 3.b of your License).  
        * Reasonable public access to content and features that allow the grant-back rights (Clause 4 of your License) to operate as intended (e.g., for you to view and potentially reuse their work).  
      * No Conflict with the Platform's Terms of Service (ToS):  
        * The chosen platform's own Terms of Service must not conflict with the rights granted or obligations imposed by your VOD Reaction License.  
        * If a platform's ToS would prevent or fundamentally contradict how this license is meant to work, that platform should not be listed by you as a Permitted Platform.  
    * Guidance if Unsure: If you are unsure about a platform's suitability regarding these points, it is advisable to conduct thorough research, seek advice if necessary, or limit your Permitted Platforms to those you are confident are compatible (such as Twitch and YouTube).  
* Important: Ensure all bracketed placeholders \[...\] are correctly and consistently updated with *your* specific information. This customized text will become *your* license that *you* offer to your community. To use the name "VOD Reaction License Version 0.1.1" for your license, please modify only the content within these placeholders. For guidance on making other types of changes, or if this template doesn't precisely fit your needs, please refer to Section 6 of this guide ("Using and Modifying This License Template").

Step 2.3: Customize and Host Your License Documents Publicly

* Your Customized License Text: The license text you customized in Step 2.2 is your core legal document.  
* Your Customized "Usage Guide for Licensees": It is highly recommended to also provide a user-friendly guide for your community to explain how they can reuse your VODs.  
  * Obtain the GUIDE\_FOR\_LICENSEES.md template (available in the same repository as the License Template, or from [https://github.com/shibatch/grantback/blob/main/GUIDE\_FOR\_LICENSEES\_V0.1.1.md](https://github.com/shibatch/grantback/blob/main/GUIDE_FOR_LICENSEES_V0.1.1.md)).  
  * Customize this guide: Fill in its placeholders (e.g., \[Licensor's Primary Channel Name\], \[Link to Your Full License Text\], your preferred notification methods for Step 2.5 of that guide, your contact details for questions).  
  * You may also modify other content within this "Usage Guide for Licensees" template to better suit your community's tone and your specific operational details, as long as it accurately reflects and does not contradict the terms of *your customized* VOD Reaction License.  
* Host Both Documents: Publish *your customized version* of the "VOD Reaction License Version 0.1.1" text AND *your customized version* of the "Usage Guide for Licensees" where they are publicly accessible via stable links (e.g., your own GitHub repository, a personal website, or separate GitHub Gists).

Step 2.4: Inform Your Community and Indicate Licensed VODs

* General Announcement: Clearly state on your channel(s) (e.g., in your Twitch "About" section, YouTube channel description, or a pinned "Licensing Information" post) that you offer some or all of your VODs for reuse under *your instance* of the "VOD Reaction License Version 0.1.1."  
  * Provide a direct link to your hosted version of the customized license text.  
  * Also, provide a direct link to your hosted version of the customized "Usage Guide for Licensees."  
* Per-VOD Indication (Highly Recommended): To provide maximum clarity for your viewers and potential Licensees, it is highly recommended that for each VOD you publish:  
  * Include your standard copyright notice (e.g., "© \[Your Year\] \[Your Channel Name\]").  
  * Clearly indicate its licensing status directly in the video's description, as an on-screen graphic (e.g., at the end of the video), or in a pinned comment. Examples:  
    * For VODs offered under this license: "This VOD is available for reuse under the VOD Reaction License Version 0.1.1. Full license terms: \[Link to Your Hosted License Text\]. Usage Guide: \[Link to Your Hosted Licensee Guide\]"  
    * For VODs NOT offered under this license: "© \[Your Year\] \[Your Channel Name\]. All rights reserved. This VOD is not available for reuse under the VOD Reaction License."  
  * This practice helps avoid confusion and ensures reusers know exactly which of your content they can use under your specific terms and how to do so.

3\. Important Considerations for You (as an Adopting Licensor)

When you choose to adopt and implement your version of the "VOD Reaction License Version 0.1.1" for your channel's VODs, please keep these key points in mind:

* You Are the Licensor:  
  By customizing and publishing this license text for your VODs, you become the "Licensor" in the agreement between you and anyone who reuses your VODs under its terms. The original author of this License Template is not a party to your agreements. You are solely responsible for offering this license and its application to your content.  
* Third-Party Content in Your VODs & Licensee Responsibilities:  
  The License you grant via this template (specifically Section 5 of the template, "Reservation of Rights and Third-Party Content in Original VODs") clarifies the following key points for your Licensees regarding third-party content found within your VODs:  
  1. Your Permissions Don't Automatically Transfer: Permissions you (the Licensor) may have to use certain third-party content in your own stream do not automatically extend to your Licensees. The license that your Licensees receive from you primarily covers your original contributions.  
  2. Licensees Must Assess and Secure Rights for Third-Party Content: Your Licensees must identify any third-party content within your VODs they wish to reuse. They are then responsible for independently assessing if their intended use is permissible (e.g., via their own license for that content, fair use doctrines) and for obtaining any necessary permissions directly from rights holders. Your VOD Reaction License does not grant these third-party rights.

Practical Guidance for You (as Licensor) on This Topic:To help your community reuse your VODs safely and effectively under this License, it is crucial to be transparent about third-party content within your VODs. Clearly designate which of your VODs are offered under this License (as advised in Step 2.4). For those VODs, if they contain significant third-party materials with known restrictive licenses that could impact reuse, making this information available to your viewers (e.g., in video descriptions or a channel FAQ) is crucial. Offering VODs or segments with minimal or broadly-licensed third-party content will simplify reuse for everyone.

A Note on Complexity: While these considerations about third-party content might seem to add complexity, it's important to remember that these copyright issues and responsibilities are inherent to any form of content reuse. This License doesn't aim to create new complications; rather, it strives to provide a more structured and transparent framework for navigating these existing issues when you wish to allow community reuse of your VODs. Granting permissions on an ad-hoc, case-by-case basis without a clear license often leaves these same issues unaddressed and potentially more confusing for everyone involved.

* Understanding the Grant-Back (Clause 4 of the License Template):  
  Remember, your Licensees (those who reuse your VODs) will grant you rights back to reuse their "Streamed Works" (the new content they create using your VODs). You, in turn, must adhere to the conditions in Clause 4 (platform limits, attributing the Licensee) when reusing their work.  
* Final Important Notes:  
  This License Template is experimental and provided as a starting point. You are solely responsible for the license you implement. It is strongly recommended to have your customized license reviewed by legal counsel to ensure it meets your specific needs and legal context before offering it to your community.

4\. A Licensee Reused Your VOD Under Your License: What Next?

So, a member of your community has created a Streamed Work using your VOD under your VOD Reaction License and (as per Clause 3.c of the license you offer) has notified you. Here’s what you might do:

* Step 4.1: Review the Licensee's Streamed Work:  
  * Watch their content\! See what they've created.  
  * Check if they've complied with your license terms, such as:  
    * Attribution to You: Have they correctly attributed your channel (as specified in your version of Clause 3.b)?  
    * Permitted Platforms: Is their Streamed Work published on one of the platforms you designated as "Permitted Platforms" in your license (as per Clause 3.a of your license)?  
* Step 4.2: Engage with the Creator (Recommended):  
  * Acknowledge their work\! A simple thank you, comment, or shout-out can go a long way in fostering a positive community.  
* Step 4.3: Consider Using Your Grant-Back Rights (Clause 4 of your license):  
  * Remember, the license grants you (the Licensor) rights to reuse their Streamed Work.  
  * You could:  
    * Feature their Streamed Work on your own stream or in a video.  
    * Create a "reacting to reactions" segment.  
    * Use clips from their Streamed Work in a compilation or highlights reel.  
* Step 4.4: If You Reuse Their Streamed Work \- Your Obligations to Them:  
  * Platform Restriction: Just like your Licensee, you must only use their Streamed Work (or derivatives you make from it) on the "Permitted Platforms" as defined in your license (as per Clause 4.a of your license).  
  * Attribution to Them (the Licensee): This is crucial. You *must* provide attribution back to the creator of that Streamed Work (as per Clause 4.b of your license).  
    * Use their primary channel name (e.g., the channel on a Permitted Platform where they published the Streamed Work, or as they otherwise indicated).  
    * If they specified a preferred name for attribution when they notified you, use that.  
    * Make the attribution clear, either visually or audibly.  
* Step 4.5: Regarding Third-Party Content in Their Streamed Work (Clause 4.e.iv of your license):  
  * The license states that the Licensee is responsible for ensuring they have the rights to any third-party content they included in their Streamed Work, such that you (the Licensor) can also reuse it under the grant-back.  
  * If you notice third-party content in their Streamed Work that you are unsure about (e.g., popular copyrighted music), it's wise to be cautious. You might choose to only use segments of their Streamed Work that are clearly their original reaction and your VOD, or discuss with the Licensee if you have concerns. The license (Clause 4.e.iv) provides a basis for this, as they agree to help identify or remove/replace problematic content if requested.

5\. Managing or Discontinuing Your License Offer

As the Licensor of your VODs under your instance of the VOD Reaction License, you have the flexibility to decide which of your VODs are offered under these terms and when you might choose to discontinue offering these terms for future reuses of your VODs. To maintain clarity with your community, continuously and clearly indicating the applicable license status (e.g., "VOD Reaction License applies" or "All Rights Reserved") on a per-VOD basis (such as in video descriptions) is highly desirable, especially when you are making changes to your licensing approach or managing a mix of licensed and unlicensed VODs.

* Stopping the Offer for Future Reuses: If you decide you no longer want to offer your VODs (or specific VODs) under this VOD Reaction License for *new, future* reuses:  
  * Do Not Delete Your Existing License Document: The version of the license text that applied to VODs already released under its terms is important for ongoing clarity and for those Licensees who relied on it. Do not delete this hosted document. Instead, you might:  
    * Keep the existing document accessible, perhaps renaming it or clearly marking it on the document itself (e.g., adding a note like "\[ARCHIVED \- These terms applied to VODs published before \[Date of Discontinuation\] and are no longer offered for new VODs\]").  
    * Ensure that links from older VODs (if they point to a specific URL for your license terms) continue to function or redirect appropriately to these archived terms if technically feasible. If not, ensure you can provide these historical terms if requested.  
  * Update Your General Channel Information:  
    * Modify any general statements on your channel (e.g., Twitch "About," YouTube description, main licensing info page) to clearly state that the VOD Reaction License is no longer being offered for VODs published after \[Date of Discontinuation\].  
    * It's good practice to explain how older VODs are licensed. For example: "VODs published before \[Date of Discontinuation\] were offered under the VOD Reaction License v1.0 (archived terms can be found here: \[Link to your specific, now-archived or clearly marked historical license text\]). VODs published on or after \[Date of Discontinuation\] are All Rights Reserved unless otherwise indicated."  
  * Mark New VODs Clearly: Ensure any VODs published *after* your discontinuation date explicitly state their new licensing status (e.g., "© \[Your Year\] \[Your Channel Name\]. All rights reserved.").  
  * Communicate the Change Broadly: Clearly announce your decision to discontinue the license offer for future VODs to your community to avoid confusion and maintain trust.  
* Changing Placeholder Information (e.g., Your Attribution Channel Name):  
  If you need to update the information you provided in the placeholders of your published VOD Reaction License (for example, if your channel name used for attribution changes), it is crucial to handle this transparently and fairly:  
  * Communicate Proactively: Clearly announce the change to your community, ideally in advance (e.g., on your channel, social media, or wherever you post license updates). Explain what is changing and why, if appropriate.  
  * Specify Effective Date: Clearly state that the new information (e.g., new attribution name) applies only to Streamed Works created *after* a specific effective date of your announcement/update.  
  * Respect Existing Compliant Works: Reassure your community that Streamed Works created and published in compliance with the placeholder information that was current *at the time of their creation* will still be considered compliant. You should not retroactively demand changes (like re-attribution) for these existing works.  
  * Update Your Hosted License Document: Ensure the license document you host and link to reflects the updated placeholder information and clearly indicates the date of the update or a version number for that instance of your license.  
* Crucial Note: Impact on Existing, Compliant Uses (Applies to both Updates and Discontinuation):  
  It is very important to understand that modifying your placeholder information or discontinuing your offer of this license for future reuses generally does not affect the rights of Licensees who have already begun Reusing your VODs in compliance with the license terms that were in effect before you made the change or withdrew the general offer.  
  Public licenses, once accepted through compliant use, grant rights that are typically irrevocable by the Licensor as long as the Licensee continues to adhere to the original conditions under which they started. The "VOD Reaction License" template's grant to the Licensee in Clause 2 explicitly includes "irrevocable (as long as the Licensee complies with all conditions of this License)," which reinforces this principle. This is crucial for building trust and encouraging good-faith reuse by your community.  
* Record Keeping and Supporting Your Community:  
  * Keep a personal record of when you started offering VODs under this license and the exact terms (including specific placeholder values and a copy of the license text) you offered at various times. If you make changes to placeholder values or discontinue the offer, record when those changes were made effective.  
  * The VOD Reaction License is designed to foster positive community interaction. Being clear, transparent, and fair in how you manage your license offer and any changes to it is fundamental to supporting that spirit. Always prioritize clear communication with your community regarding your licensing decisions.

5\. Managing or Discontinuing Your License Offer

As the Licensor of your VODs under your instance of the VOD Reaction License, you have the flexibility to decide which of your VODs are offered under these terms and when you might choose to discontinue offering these terms for future reuses of your VODs. To maintain clarity with your community, continuously and clearly indicating the applicable license status (e.g., "VOD Reaction License applies" or "All Rights Reserved") on a per-VOD basis (such as in video descriptions) is highly desirable, especially when you are making changes to your licensing approach or managing a mix of licensed and unlicensed VODs.

* Stopping the Offer for Future Reuses: If you decide you no longer want to offer your VODs (or specific VODs) under this license for *new* reuses, you can do so by:  
  * Removing the license statement and link from your channel page(s) (Twitch About, YouTube description, etc.).  
  * Clearly indicating on any newly published VODs that they are *not* offered under this license (e.g., by stating "All rights reserved" or specifying different terms).  
* Impact on Existing Uses: It's very important to understand that discontinuing your offer of this license generally does not affect the rights of Licensees who have already begun Reusing your VODs in compliance with the license terms *before* you withdrew the offer. Public licenses like this, once accepted through use, typically grant rights that cannot be unilaterally revoked by the Licensor as long as the Licensee continues to adhere to the conditions. This is crucial for building trust and encouraging good-faith reuse. (Note: The VOD Reaction License template's grant to the Licensee in Clause 2 explicitly includes "irrevocable (as long as the Licensee complies with all conditions of this License)," which provides this clarity.)  
* Changing Placeholder Information (e.g., Your Attribution Channel Name): If you need to update the information you provided in the placeholders of your published VOD Reaction License (for example, if your channel name used for attribution changes), it is crucial to handle this transparently and fairly:  
  * Communicate the Change: Clearly announce the change to your community (e.g., on your channel, social media, or wherever you post license updates).  
  * Effective Date: Specify that the new information applies to Streamed Works created *after* the date of your announcement/update.  
  * Existing Works: Reassure your community that Streamed Works created and published in compliance with the placeholder information that was current *at the time of their creation* will still be considered compliant. You should not retroactively demand changes to attribution for already existing compliant works based on your new details.  
  * Versioning Your License Instance (Optional but Recommended): If you make significant changes to placeholder information that affects how Licensees comply (like attribution details), consider versioning your specific instance of the license (e.g., by adding a "Last Updated \[Date\]" note to your hosted license document) and clearly communicating which version applies to which period of VOD reuse.  
* Communicating Changes: If you decide to stop offering VODs under this license, clearly communicate this change to your community to avoid confusion.  
* Record Keeping: It's good practice to keep a personal record of when you started offering VODs under this license and, if you decide to stop, when that change was made effective for future VODs or future reuses.  
* Supporting Your Community: The VOD Reaction License is designed to foster positive community interaction. Being clear and fair about how you manage your license offer is part of that spirit.

6\. Using and Modifying This License Template

The "VOD Reaction License Version 0.1.1" text template (which you can find at [https://github.com/shibatch/grantback/blob/main/VOD\_REACTION\_LICENSE\_V0.1.1.md](https://github.com/shibatch/grantback/blob/main/VOD_REACTION_LICENSE_V0.1.1.md)) is provided to help you establish a clear framework for VOD reuse for your channel.  
Please refer to Section 11 ("Distribution and Modification of This License Document") of the License Template itself for the precise terms under which you may copy, distribute, and modify the template text. In summary, those terms allow you to:

* Copy and Distribute Verbatim: You are permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of the License Template document.  
* Adapt by Filling Placeholders: To create *your instance* of the "VOD Reaction License Version 0.1.1" for your VODs, you must modify the template only by accurately filling in the clearly designated placeholder sections (e.g., \[Licensor's Primary Channel Name\], \[Your Year\], \[Licensor's Designated Channel Name for Attribution\], etc.) with your specific information. No other changes to the core legal clauses are permitted if you wish to call your license the "VOD Reaction License Version 0.1.1" or a confusingly similar name.  
* Creating a New, Different License: If you wish to modify the core legal terms of the License Template (beyond the designated placeholders), the resulting document will be a new and distinct license. In such a case, you must not call your modified license the "VOD Reaction License Version 0.1.1" or use any name that could cause confusion with it. You should give your new license a unique name.

This approach to the License Template text is designed to ensure that any license publicly identified as a "VOD Reaction License Version 0.1.1" maintains a consistent set of core terms, which benefits both Licensors and Licensees by providing predictability and clarity across the community.  
The accompanying guide documents in this repository (like this "Guide for Streamers Adopting..." and the GUIDE\_FOR\_LICENSEES.md template, if provided by the original template author) are typically offered under a more permissive license like Creative Commons CC BY-SA 4.0, allowing you to adapt them for your own community (with attribution and by sharing your adaptations under similar terms). Check the specific licensing for guide documents in the repository where you obtained this template.
