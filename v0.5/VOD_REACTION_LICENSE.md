2\. License Grant for Licensed Content

The Licensor grants to the Licensee, for no monetary compensation due to the Licensor, a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual (for the duration of any and all applicable intellectual property and proprietary rights, including copyright, in the Licensed Content), irrevocable (as long as the Licensee complies with all conditions of this License), and non-transferable license to copy, adapt, remix, transform, excerpt, and create new works based on the Licensed Content (resulting in Derivative Works), provided that any public publication of such Derivative Works by the Licensee is restricted solely to the Permitted Platforms; provided, however, that this license may be transferred to a successor entity in connection with a sale, merger, or other corporate reorganization of the Licensee's entire business or specific assets to which this license relates.

This grant is subject to all conditions in this license. The permissibility of commercial use of the Derivative Work under this license is governed exclusively by the terms, if any, set forth by the Licensor in Clause 3.f. Unless Clause 3.f explicitly states that commercial use is not permitted, commercial use is permitted under the terms of this license.

3\. Conditions of this License

a. Platform Restriction:  
The Licensee's Derivative Work may only be publicly published, shared, or made available on the Permitted Platforms. This restriction does not prohibit the Non-Public Sharing of such Derivative Work with Collaborators. Publication on any other platform is not permitted under this license.

b. Attribution to Licensor:  
The Licensee must provide Attribution to the Licensor in each Derivative Work. The specific name to be used for Attribution shall be the "[Licensor's Designated Channel Name for Attribution]" or as otherwise specified by the Licensor.

c. Acceptance of License and Reporting to Licensor:  
The Licensee must provide notification to the Licensor regarding their Derivative Work through one of the methods specified by the Licensor here: **\[Adopting Licensor: Specify your required notification method(s) here. For example: "by sending an email to (your email address)," "by filling out the form at (link to form)," or "by mentioning @(your Twitter handle) on Twitter".\]**. This notification must be provided prior to publishing the Derivative Work. The provision of this notification, regardless of its timing, constitutes the Licensee's irrevocable declaration of explicit acceptance of all terms and conditions of this License for the creation and publication of that Derivative Work. Any notification provided after publication constitutes a breach of the timing requirement of this Clause. This notification must serve to identify the legal party acting as the Licensee. If the Licensee is a legal entity (e.g., a corporation or LLC), this notification must include the official name of that entity. If the Licensee is an individual, identification by their publicly established channel name or pseudonym shall be deemed sufficient for the purposes of this notification. The Licensee is not required to await a response from the Licensor before publishing.

d. Provision of Derivative Work Data to Licensor:  
Upon the Licensor's request, the Licensee must promptly provide the Licensor with a digital copy of the relevant portions of the Licensee's Derivative Work that incorporate the Licensor's Licensed Content. When such provided digital copy constitutes a Provided Copy, it must satisfy the following conditions in relation to the Published Version from which it is derived:

(i) The Provided Copy must completely include all parts within the Published Version that incorporate the Licensor's Licensed Content.

(ii) Editing of the Provided Copy, transforming it from the Published Version, shall be limited to the minimum extent objectively necessary to clear third-party rights present in the Published Version (e.g., muting of relevant segments, replacement or removal of third-party materials). No other substantive or stylistic editing altering the content or presentation of the parts described in Clause 3.d(i) as they appeared in the Published Version is permitted, except for minor technical or format adjustments that do not materially alter the content or presentation.

(iii) If, as a direct result of the editing permitted under Clause 3.d(ii), important parts (such as the Licensee's own speech) present in the Published Version are unavoidably lost or obscured in the Provided Copy, the Licensee must, concurrently with providing the Provided Copy, notify the Licensor of the nature and content of such lost parts by reasonable and good-faith means (e.g., by providing a textual transcript of the lost speech; or, if the lost speech itself consists of third-party copyrighted material, by providing a clear reference to its original source).

The digital copy provided under this Clause 3.d shall be in a common digital format and delivered via a reasonable method. Furthermore, if additional data beyond the digital copy of the Published Version itself is required to enable reasonable modification of the work (for example, a higher-resolution version of the work if the Published Version was distributed in a compressed or lower-resolution format, or the source code if the work is a computer program), that additional data must also be included as part of the Provided Copy.

e. General Responsibility for Derivative Work:  
The Licensee is solely responsible for all content within their Derivative Work and for ensuring that such Derivative Work complies with all applicable laws and does not infringe upon any third-party rights, including but not limited to copyright (beyond the rights granted herein for the Licensor's Licensed Content), patent, trademark, publicity rights, privacy rights, or any other personal or proprietary rights. The Licensor assumes no liability for the content or consequences of the Licensee's Derivative Work.

f. Additional Restrictions by Licensor:  
The Licensor may specify additional restrictions below. Such restrictions may only pertain to (i) the permissibility of commercial use, and (ii) objective conditions on the content and characteristics of the Derivative Work itself, where a condition is considered valid only if its fulfillment can be verified solely by inspection of the Derivative Work.

**\[Adopting Licensor: This is where you specify your rules according to the limitations described above. To prohibit or place conditions on commercial use, you MUST state those restrictions here. As stated in Clause 2, if this section contains no explicit restriction on commercial use, then commercial use will be permitted by default. If you have no additional restrictions to add at all, replace this entire comment with the word "None." For detailed instructions and examples, please see the Guide for Adopters.\]**

4\. Grant-Back License for the Licensee's Derivative Works

For each Derivative Work published by a Licensee who has accepted the terms of this License pursuant to Clause 3.c, the Licensee hereby grants back to the Licensor, for no monetary compensation due to the Licensee, a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, and non-transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, display, perform, adapt, and create derivative works from such Derivative Work; provided, however, that this license may be transferred to a successor entity in connection with a sale, merger, or other corporate reorganization of the Licensor's entire business or specific assets to which this license relates. The permissibility of commercial use of the Derivative Work by the Licensor under this grant-back shall be the same as the permissibility of commercial use granted to the Licensee under Clause 2 of this license.

This license granted back to the Licensor is subject to the following conditions. This grant-back applies only to Derivative Works created by the Licensee that incorporate the Licensor's Licensed Content under this license and does not apply to any other works created by the Licensee.

a. Platform Restriction for Licensor:  
The Licensor's use of such Derivative Work, and any derivatives thereof created by the Licensor, may only be publicly published, shared, or made available on the Permitted Platforms. This restriction does not prohibit the Non-Public Sharing of such works with the Licensor's own Collaborators.

b. Attribution to Licensee by Licensor:  
When using such Derivative Work, the Licensor must provide Attribution to the Licensee. The specific name to be used for Attribution shall be the Licensee's primary channel name (e.g., the Licensee's Twitch or YouTube channel name, whichever is primarily associated with such Derivative Work, or as the Licensee may otherwise instruct the Licensor in writing).

c. Collaborative Use by Licensor:  
The Licensor's right to use the Derivative Work in collaborative content is governed by the following:

(i) Use on the Licensor's Channels: The Licensor may feature the Derivative Work (and any new works created from it) on the Licensor's own channels on the Permitted Platforms, even when other creators appear as guests or co-hosts.

(ii) Use on Other Channels: The Licensor may not permit a third party (such as a collaborator) to primarily or independently publish the Derivative Work (or any new work created from it by the Licensor) on a channel not operated by the Licensor without obtaining the Licensee's prior explicit approval for that specific use. This applies even if the Licensor appears in the third party's content.

d. Sublicensing by Licensor:  
The Licensor may grant necessary sublicenses to the operators of the Permitted Platforms (as per their respective Terms of Service) to the extent required to host, display, and enable platform features for such Derivative Work when featured on the Licensor's channels or for collaborative broadcasts conducted in accordance with Clause 4.c. Except as expressly permitted in this Clause 4.d (specifically regarding platform operators), any other form of sublicensing of such Derivative Work by the Licensor to third parties for their independent use is not permitted by this license without the Licensee's separate approval.

e. Terms Applicable to Derivative Work Provided Under Grant-Back:  
When the Licensee grants back the license to the Licensee's Derivative Work to the Licensor under this Clause 4, the following terms also apply to that specific grant:  

(i) The Licensee provides the Licensee's Derivative Work to the Licensor "AS-IS," without any warranties from the Licensee to the Licensor, express or implied. The Licensee specifically disclaims any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement regarding the Licensee's Derivative Work.

(ii) In no event shall the Licensee be liable to the Licensor for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption) however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the Licensor's use or inability to use such Derivative Work, even if the Licensee were advised of the possibility of such damage. This limitation shall not apply to the extent that such damages are caused by the Licensee's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

(iii) All rights in the Licensee's Derivative Work not expressly granted back to the Licensor under this Clause 4 are reserved by the Licensee.

(iv) The Licensee represents and warrants that the Licensee has obtained all necessary rights, licenses, consents, and permissions for all content (including the Licensee's original contributions and any third-party content the Licensee incorporated) within the Provided Copy, including any additional data or materials provided pursuant to Clause 3.d, to grant the full scope of the license to the Licensor as described in this Clause 4, free of any encumbrances or restrictions that would prevent the Licensor's exercise of such rights. The Licensee agrees that if any third-party content the Licensee included in the Provided Copy is not clear for the Licensor's reuse under this grant-back, the Licensee will, upon request, endeavor to identify such content to the Licensor or take reasonable steps to remove or replace it to enable the Licensor's use. The Licensor's use of the Provided Copy is reliant on these representations and warranties, and the Licensee acknowledges that they may be held liable for direct losses incurred by the Licensor as a result of any material breach thereof.

5\. Reservation of Rights and Third-Party Content in Original Licensed Content

All rights in the Licensed Content not expressly granted by the Licensor in this license are hereby reserved by the Licensor. To the best of the Licensor's knowledge, the original content created by the Licensor within the Licensed Content does not infringe upon the intellectual property or proprietary rights of third parties. This license grants rights only to such original content created by the Licensor. This license does not grant the Licensee any rights to use third-party content protected by rights such as copyright, patent, trademark, or publicity rights, that may be incidentally included in the Licensed Content (e.g., in-game music, other's video clips, audio clips, illustrations, 3D models, computer programs, or copyrighted music played during the stream). If the Licensee chooses to Reuse portions of the Licensed Content that include such third-party content, the Licensee is solely responsible for determining if its use is permissible (e.g., under fair use doctrines or other exceptions) and for obtaining any necessary permissions from the respective rights holders of that third-party content. The Licensor makes no further warranties and assumes no liability regarding the clearance or suitability of any third-party content within the Licensed Content for the Licensee's Reuse.

6\. Warranty Disclaimer

The Licensed Content is provided "AS-IS" without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. The Licensor disclaims all warranties, including but not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. The Licensee uses the Licensed Content at the Licensee's own risk.

7\. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall the Licensor be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption) however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the use or inability to use the Licensed Content, even if advised of the possibility of such damage. This limitation shall not apply to the extent that such damages are caused by the Licensor's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

8\. Violation, Cure, and Actions

a. Notification and Provisional Suspension: If the Licensee fails to comply with any condition of this License, the Licensor may, at their sole discretion, notify the Licensee by sending a formal Notice of Violation. This Notice of Violation must identify the specific Derivative Work(s) and the nature of the violation. Effective upon the sending of such Notice of Violation, the following permissions granted under this license shall be provisionally suspended:

(i) The permission for the Derivative Work(s) identified in the notice.

(ii) The permission for the Licensee to create and publish any new Derivative Works.

b. Cure Period and Reinstatement: The Licensee shall have a period of one (1) month from the date of receipt of the Notice of Violation (hereinafter "Cure Period") to cure the specified violation. The Licensor may, at their sole discretion, extend this Cure Period at any time by providing written notice to the Licensee. The following process shall govern the cure and its confirmation:

(i) Initiation of Confirmation: To receive confirmation of a cure's acceptance, the Licensee may, at any time during the Cure Period, send a Notification of Cure to the Licensor.

(ii) Review and Acceptance by Silence: Upon receipt of a Notification of Cure, the Licensor shall have seven (7) days to review the cure. If the Licensor does not send a Notice of Insufficiency to the Licensee within this seven-day review period, the cure shall be deemed accepted.

(iii) Subsequent Cure Attempts: If the Licensor sends a Notice of Insufficiency, the Licensee shall have an additional seven (7) days from the date of receipt of that notice to attempt a subsequent cure. The Licensee may re-initiate the confirmation process for this new cure attempt by sending another Notification of Cure, as described in 8.b(i).

(iv) Final Determination: Regardless of whether the optional confirmation process in 8.b(i)-(iii) was used, upon the expiration of the overall Cure Period (including any and all extensions thereof), the Licensor shall make a final determination based on a good-faith review of whether the violation has been completely cured.

(v) Effect of Cure: If a cure is deemed complete, either through the process in 8.b(i)-(iii) or by the final determination in 8.b(iv), the permissions provisionally suspended under Clause 8.a shall be reinstated, and the license shall continue in full force and effect. The failure to achieve a complete cure by the expiration of the Cure Period shall be deemed a failure to cure under Clause 8.c.

c. Actions upon Failure to Cure: If the Licensee fails to cure the violation within the Cure Period, the following measures shall apply:

(i) Permanent Revocation for the Infringing Content: The permission for the Derivative Work(s) identified in the notice, which was provisionally suspended under Clause 8.a, shall be automatically and permanently revoked.

(ii) Optional Termination of the Entire License: In addition to the revocation in Clause 8.c(i), the Licensor may, at their sole discretion, also permanently terminate this entire license agreement. The Licensor may set the effective date of this termination retroactively. The earliest date to which this termination can be backdated shall be the date of the first violation that the Licensee failed to remedy. For the purpose of determining the "first violation that the Licensee failed to remedy," any such failure under a prior license agreement that was subsequently terminated and re-granted by the Licensor shall be included, provided that the prior agreement was an instance of the VOD Reaction License Version 0.5 template or an instance thereof with additional remedial conditions specific to that re-licensing. A failure to cure within the Cure Period shall constitute prima facie evidence of willful infringement, justifying retroactive termination.

d. Time Limit on Exercise of Termination Rights: The Licensor must exercise their rights to permanently terminate the entire license agreement under Clause 8.c(ii) promptly after the expiration of the Cure Period. The Licensor is prohibited from holding these rights in reserve to exercise them at a significantly later date for the same underlying violation.

e. Survival: Clauses 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10 shall survive any permanent revocation of permission under Clause 8.c(i) or any permanent termination of this license under Clause 8.c(ii). Furthermore, the survival of Clause 4 shall apply even when a termination of the Licensee's rights is declared retroactively by the Licensor in accordance with this Clause.

f. Re-grant After Final Termination: After the license has been permanently terminated under Clause 8.c(ii), any future permission must be granted via a separate, explicit agreement with the Licensor.


9\. Excusable Non-Performance

Neither party shall be held liable for any failure or delay in performing any of its obligations under this License if such failure or delay (a) is caused by circumstances genuinely beyond its reasonable control, (b) occurs without its fault or negligence, and (c) could not have been prevented by reasonable precautions. Such circumstances may include, without limitation, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, epidemics, pandemics, serious personal illness or injury that renders performance impossible, or significant and widespread failures of essential third-party services or infrastructure (such as internet, power, or Permitted Platform outages) not caused by the party claiming excuse. The party affected by such circumstances shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of the non-performance and to resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable.

10\. General Provisions

a. If any provision of this license is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.

b. This license constitutes the entire agreement between the Licensee and the Licensor concerning the subject matter hereof.

c. Order of Precedence. In the event of any conflict, ambiguity, or inconsistency between the information provided by the Licensor within any placeholder of this License and the standard, non-placeholder provisions of this License, the standard, non-placeholder provisions shall govern and control.

d. Identification of Licensor. The party offering this license as the Licensor must, in the space designated for the Copyright Notice, clearly and accurately identify the legal party acting as the Licensor. If the Licensor is a legal entity (e.g., a corporation), its official registered name must be used. If the Licensor is an individual, the use of a publicly established channel name or pseudonym under which they consistently operate shall be deemed a sufficient identification for the purposes of this license. Ambiguous or incomplete identification of the Licensor may affect the validity and enforceability of this license.

11\. Distribution and Modification of This License Document 

This document is the "VOD Reaction License Version 0.5" (hereinafter "the License Template"). The authoritative source for this License Template and accompanying guides can be found at: [https://github.com/shibatch/grantback](https://github.com/shibatch/grantback)

Permission is granted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document. You (meaning anyone wishing to adopt this license template for their own Licensed Content) may modify this license document solely by accurately replacing the content within the clearly designated placeholder sections (typically marked with \[square brackets and placeholder text\], such as \[Licensor's Primary Channel Name\], \[Year\], \[Licensor's Name or Channel Name / Operator\], and \[Licensor's Designated Channel Name for Attribution\]) with your own specific information to create your instance of this license. Such modification of placeholder content is necessary to adapt this license template for your use as a Licensor.

Changing any other part of the core legal terms of this document is not permitted if you wish to distribute your version or refer to it as the "VOD Reaction License Version 0.5" or any confusingly similar name. If you create a modified version by altering the core legal terms (beyond the designated placeholders), that version constitutes a new and distinct license, and you may not represent it as being this "VOD Reaction License Version 0.5".

This permission applies only to the text of this license document itself and does not grant any rights to Licensed Content or Derivative Works, which are governed solely by the terms an implementing Licensor offers through their specific instance of this license.  

The restrictions in this Clause 11 on modifying the core legal terms of this License Template apply to the public offer of this license. Nothing in this Clause 11 shall prevent a Licensor and a specific Licensee from entering into a separate, private agreement to re-license the content following a termination under Clause 8. The additional conditions that can be included in such an agreement are limited to those reasonably aimed at remedying the prior violation or managing future compliance.
