## Guide for Streamers: Adopting and Using the VOD Reaction License Template

### 1\. Introduction: What is the VOD Reaction License and Why Use It?

Welcome\! This guide is for streamers interested in using the "VOD Reaction License Version 0.5" template (hereinafter "the License Template") to license their own VODs for reuse by their community.  

The VOD Reaction License (VRL) model is designed to foster a more interactive and collaborative streaming community. Its core purposes and benefits include:

* Encouraging Community Content: By clearly stating terms for reuse, you make it easier for viewers and other creators to make reaction content, compilations, reviews, or other derivative works ("Derivative Works") using your VODs.  
* Increasing Your Visibility: Especially for growing channels, having others react to or feature your content can introduce your work to new audiences.  
* Facilitating Dialogue (The Grant-Back Feature): A key feature is the "grant-back" clause. When someone creates a Derivative Work from your VODs, they grant you a license to reuse *their* Derivative Work. This allows you to "react to their reaction," engage directly with community content, or address any points raised.  
* Maintaining Some Control: The license restricts reuse to specific platforms (Twitch and YouTube by default) and requires clear attribution to your original VODs, helping you manage how your content is shared and acknowledged.

This License Template is a custom-designed license. We believe it offers a unique way to engage with your community. It's important to understand its terms and how to implement it correctly for your channel.

<details>
<summary>The text of this License Template itself is offered with specific permissions regarding its copying and modification.</summary>
&nbsp;  

You can copy and distribute it, and you can adapt it for your own use by filling in the designated placeholders. However, to maintain consistency for the "VOD Reaction License Version 0.5" model, modifications to the core legal terms (beyond placeholders) mean your version should be considered a new, distinct license. Full details on how you can use and adapt the license template text are provided in Clause 11 of the License Template document itself, and further explained in Section 7 of this guide.

### 2\. How to Adopt This License for Your Channel: Step-by-Step

If you wish to use this license model for your VODs, you will be offering your own version of this license to your viewers. Here’s how:

<details>
<summary>Step 2.1: Obtain the License Template Text</summary>

* You can find the master text for the "VOD Reaction License Version 0.5" template here: [VOD\_REACTION\_LICENSE.md](VOD_REACTION_LICENSE.md)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Step 2.2: Customize the Placeholders in Your Copy</summary>

* Copy the full License Template text.  
* Carefully find and replace all bracketed placeholders \[...\] with your own specific information. These include:  
  * \[Licensor's Primary Channel Name\]: Your main channel name (e.g., "YourStreamChannel").  
  * \[Adopting Licensor: Specify your required notification method(s) here...\] (in Clause 3.c of the License Template): This is a placeholder where you must define the specific, official methods through which your community members can notify you of their derivative works.
  * \[Year\] and \[Licensor's Name or Channel Name / Operator\] (in the Copyright notice section of the License Template): The current year and your legal name, channel name, or operating entity name.  
    * (A Note on Your Copyright Line): The format Copyright (c) \[Year\] \[Your Name/Entity\] is common. For content like your VODs, you might also choose to state, for example: "Copyright (c) \[Year\] \[Your Channel Name\]. My VODs under this license are offered via the VOD Reaction License Version 0.5." The phrase "All rights reserved." (often seen with software) is generally optional for content, as your rights are reserved by copyright law anyway, and Clause 5 of the License Template ("Reservation of Rights") already clarifies this. Select a style that you are comfortable with for your channel.  
    * If you are offering this license as a legal entity (e.g., a corporation), you must state the official registered name of that entity in this copyright notice section. Accurate identification is a condition for this license's validity under Clause 10.d.
    * If you are offering the license as an individual, the license deems your publicly established channel name or pseudonym to be a legally sufficient identifier. This allows you to offer the license without disclosing your real name.
  * \[Licensor's Designated Channel Name for Attribution\] (in Definition 1.f and Clause 3.b of the License Template): The specific channel name you want *your* Licensees (your VOD reusers) to credit when they use your VODs.  
* Basic notes on replacing placeholders:
  * When you customize the license by replacing placeholder text, please be sure to delete the entire bracketed comment, including the square brackets \[ and \] themselves. The final, published license should only contain your own information, not the instructional comments from the template.
  * Ensure all bracketed placeholders \[...\] are correctly and consistently updated with *your* specific information. This customized text will become *your* license that *you* offer to your community.
  * To use the name "VOD Reaction License Version 0.5" for your license, please modify only the content within these placeholders. For guidance on making other types of changes, or if this template doesn't precisely fit your needs, please refer to Section 7 of this guide ("Using and Modifying This License Template").
</details>

<details>
<summary>Important Considerations When Choosing/Adding Permitted Platforms (Clause 1.d)</summary>
&nbsp;

As the Licensor adopting this template, you have the flexibility to designate other platforms. However, the responsibility for this choice rests entirely with you.  
* This License Template is primarily written with Twitch and YouTube in mind as common distribution platforms for Derivative Works.  
* If you add platforms beyond or instead of Twitch and YouTube, you MUST confirm the following:  
   * Functional Compatibility with this License: The platform must genuinely support the core mechanisms of the VRL. Key functionalities to verify include:  
      * The platform's general ability to host and publicly display video content.  
      * Clear and practical ways for Licensees to provide Attribution to you.  
      * Reasonable public access to content and features that allow the grant-back rights to operate as intended (e.g., for you to view and potentially reuse their work).  
   * No Conflict with the Platform's Terms of Service (ToS):  
      * The chosen platform's own Terms of Service must not conflict with the rights granted or obligations imposed by your customized VRL.  
* If you are unsure about a platform's suitability regarding these points, it is advisable to limit your Permitted Platforms to those you are confident are compatible (such as Twitch and YouTube).  
</details>

<details>
<summary>Customizing Clause 3.f: Adding Your Own Rules</summary>
&nbsp;  

The License Template includes an optional section, Clause 3.f "Additional Restrictions by Licensor," where you can add your own custom rules. 

The License limits the types of rules you can add in this section. As stated in the main text of Clause 3.f, your custom restrictions may only pertain to (i) the permissibility of commercial use, and (ii) conditions regarding the Derivative Work itself. You cannot add restrictions unrelated to these topics (e.g., demanding royalties or requiring social media follows).

If you have no rules to add, simply replace the placeholder comment in your license text with the word "None.".

Understanding the Default Rule for Commercial Use:  
Please be aware of the default behavior set in Clause 2: If you do not add a specific restriction on commercial use in Clause 3.f, commercial use WILL BE PERMITTED.  

How to Use Clause 3.f:  

* To PROHIBIT commercial use: You must add an explicit rule here to override the default.

  Example: Commercial use of the Derivative Work is not permitted under this license.  

   When prohibiting "commercial use," the question of whether standard platform monetization features—such as YouTube's Super Chat, Membership Gifts, Super Thanks, or Twitch's Bits, Subscriptions, and Sub Gifts—are included in the definition of "commercial use" can be ambiguous and a potential source of conflict. It is recommended that you explicitly clarify how these features are to be treated.

* To add OTHER conditions regarding the Derivative Work: You can also list other brand-safety or conduct rules, as long as they relate directly to the content of the Derivative Work.

  Example:  
  * Derivative Works must not be presented in a way that could reasonably be mistaken for official content produced by the Licensor.
  * Derivative Works must not contain content that is contrary to public order and morals, or that is intended to harm the image of the Licensor or any third party.
  * Use of the VODs in content primarily focused on expressing or promoting specific ideologies, beliefs, religions, or political positions is not permitted.  

IMPORTANT: The only restrictions you may add in the placeholder are those that fall within the two categories permitted in Clause 3.f of the License, and you are not allowed to add rules that conflict with the core terms of the License. If a Licensor adds terms that fall outside of these conditions, that particular term will be deemed invalid under Clause 10.a of the License.

In addition, to ensure fairness and clarity, the conditions described within this placeholder should be objectively predictable.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Step 2.3: Customize and Host Your License Documents Publicly</summary>

* Your Customized License Text: The license text you customized in Step 2.2 is your core legal document.  
* Your Customized "Usage Guide for Licensees": It is highly recommended to provide a guide for your community to explain how they can reuse your VODs.  
  * Obtain the [GUIDE\_FOR\_LICENSEES.md](GUIDE_FOR_LICENSEES.md) template.  
  * Customize this guide: Fill in its placeholders.  
  * You may also modify other content within this template to better suit your specific operational details, as long as it accurately reflects and does not contradict the terms of your customized VRL.  
* Host Both Documents: Publish *your customized version* of the "VOD Reaction License Version 0.5" text AND *your customized version* of the "Usage Guide for Licensees" where they are publicly accessible via stable links (e.g., your own GitHub repository, a personal website, or separate GitHub Gists).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Step 2.4: Inform Your Community and Indicate Licensed VODs</summary>

* General Announcement: Clearly state on your channel(s) (e.g., in your Twitch "About" section, YouTube channel description, or a pinned "Licensing Information" post) that you offer some or all of your VODs for reuse under *your instance* of the "VOD Reaction License Version 0.5."  
  * Provide a direct link to your hosted version of the customized license text.  
  * Also, provide a direct link to your hosted version of the customized "Usage Guide for Licensees."  
  * Below is an example of this announcement:  
   > * **VODs from this channel may be reused under the following conditions:**
   >   * Directly recording and rebroadcasting live streams is prohibited. Only VODs (archived recordings) are eligible for reuse under this license.
   >   * The applicable distribution license and its version for each VOD is indicated at the beginning or end of the video, or in its description. If no license is indicated for a VOD, please seek individual permission before reusing it.
   >   * The license versions currently or previously used on this channel, along with their respective license texts and usage guides, are listed below. Please refer to the materials corresponding to the version applicable to the VOD you are using. 
   >   * VOD Reaction License Version 0.X:
   >      * License Text: \[Link to Your Hosted V0.X License Text\]
   >      * Usage guide for Licensees: \[Link to Your Hosted V0.X Licensee Guide\]  
   >   * VOD Reaction License Version 0.Y:
   >      * License Text: \[Link to Your Hosted V0.Y License Text\]
   >      * Usage guide for Licensees: \[Link to Your Hosted V0.Y Licensee Guide\]  
* Per-VOD Indication: Clearly indicating the licensing status for each VOD you publish is crucial. This not only provides clarity but is also essential for protecting your own rights, as it makes it very difficult for a reuser to later claim they were unaware of the license terms. Therefore, for each VOD you publish, it is recommended that you:  
  * Include your standard copyright notice (e.g., "© \[Your Year\] \[Your Channel Name\]").  
  * Clearly indicate its licensing status. Examples:  
    * For VODs offered under this license: "This VOD is available for reuse under the VOD Reaction License Version 0.5. Full license terms: \[Link to Your Hosted License Text\]. Usage Guide: \[Link to Your Hosted Licensee Guide\]"  
    * For VODs NOT offered under this license: "© \[Your Year\] \[Your Channel Name\]. All rights reserved. This VOD is not available for reuse under the VOD Reaction License."  
</details>

<details>
<summary>Regarding YouTube Licensing and its Relation to the Standard YouTube License</summary>
&nbsp;  

When you upload a VOD to YouTube, you can select either the "Standard YouTube License" or "Creative Commons (CC BY)" as the license setting. The VRL is a custom license, different from these options. Therefore, if you are applying the VRL to VODs you publish on YouTube, please keep the following in mind:  

* Upload Setting: In YouTube's upload settings, please select the "Standard YouTube License."
* Indicate Additional Permissions: In your video description or on your channel's "About" page, provide a link to the full text of your VRL and clearly state that you grant additional permissions for reuse under this license.
* Permitted Uses: Your VODs may be used to the extent permitted under the terms of either the Standard YouTube License or the VRL. The Standard YouTube License provides users with a license for basic viewing on the YouTube platform, while the VRL grants your community additional permissions for more specific secondary uses of your VODs (such as creating reaction videos) under the conditions you have set.

By clearly indicating the application of the VRL in this way, you can permit your community to reuse your VODs under the clear conditions you've established, for uses that might not typically be allowed under the Standard YouTube License alone.
</details>

### 3\. Important Considerations for You (as an Adopting Licensor)

When you choose to adopt and implement your version of the "VOD Reaction License Version 0.5" for your channel's VODs, please keep these key points in mind:

#### 3.1 You Are the Licensor

By customizing and publishing this license text for your VODs, you become the "Licensor" in the agreement between you and anyone who reuses your VODs under its terms. The original author of this License Template ([Naoki Shibata](https://github.com/shibatch)) is not a party to your agreements. You are solely responsible for offering this license and its application to your content.


#### 3.2 Navigating Third-Party Content in Your VODs

The License you grant via this template (specifically Clause 5 of the License, "Reservation of Rights and Third-Party Content in Original VODs") clarifies key points for your Licensees regarding third-party content found *within your VODs*:

<details>
<summary>Your Permissions Don't Automatically Transfer</summary>
&nbsp;

Permissions you (the Licensor) may have to use certain third-party content in your own stream do not automatically extend to your Licensees. The license that your Licensees receive from you primarily covers *your original contributions*.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>Licensees Must Assess and Secure Rights for Third-Party Content</summary>
&nbsp;

Your Licensees must identify any third-party content within your VODs they wish to reuse. They are then responsible for independently assessing if their intended use is permissible (e.g., via their own license for that content, fair use doctrines applicable in their jurisdiction) and for obtaining any necessary permissions directly from rights holders. Your VRL does not grant these third-party rights.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Practical Guidance for You (as Licensor) on This Topic</summary>
&nbsp;

To help your community reuse your VODs safely and effectively under this License, it is crucial to be transparent about third-party content within your VODs. Clearly designate which of your VODs are offered under this License (as advised in Section 2.4 of this guide). For those VODs, if they contain significant third-party materials with known restrictive licenses that could impact reuse, making this information available to your viewers (e.g., in video descriptions or a channel FAQ) is crucial. Offering VODs or segments with minimal or broadly-licensed third-party content will simplify reuse for everyone.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>A Note on Complexity</summary>
&nbsp;

While these considerations about third-party content might seem to add complexity, it's important to remember that these copyright issues and responsibilities are inherent to any form of content reuse. Granting permissions on an ad-hoc, case-by-case basis without a clear license often leaves these same issues unaddressed and potentially more confusing for everyone involved. This License doesn't aim to create new complications; rather, it strives to provide a more structured and transparent framework for navigating these existing issues when you wish to allow community reuse of your VODs.
</details>

#### 3.3 Understanding the Grant-Back (License Clause 4\)

<details>
<summary>A core feature of the License is the "grant-back" (detailed in Clause 4), where your Licensees grant you rights back to reuse their "Derivative Works."</summary>
&nbsp;

It is vital to understand the nature of the rights you receive.  

The terms of this grant-back are fixed by the License and are designed to be mostly symmetrical to the rights you grant. The **Licensee cannot unilaterally change these grant-back terms**. This means that, by default (unless you use Clause 3.f to prohibit commercial use entirely), the license you receive back from the Licensee allows you to use their Derivative Work for commercial purposes and without paying them royalties, just as they can use yours.  

This ensures a fair and predictable exchange. You allow your community to build upon your work, and in return, you have the right to celebrate, comment on, and incorporate their creative responses back into your own content stream under the same basic financial terms. When reusing their work, you, in turn, must adhere to the conditions in Clause 4 (such as platform limits and, importantly, attributing the Licensee).
</details>

#### 3.4 The "Provided Copy": What You Receive for Grant-Back Use (License Clauses 3.d & 4.e.iv)

A significant aspect of the VRL concerns the specific copy of the Licensee's Derivative Work you may request and receive for grant-back reuse. To manage this, Clause 3.d of the License defines key terms: the "Published Version" (the Derivative Work as publicly distributed by the Licensee) and the "Provided Copy" (the digital copy prepared for and delivered to you, particularly for grant-back).

<details>
<summary>Understanding what you are entitled to in this "Provided Copy" is key.</summary>

* Your Right to Request: You have the right to request a digital copy of relevant portions of a Licensee's Derivative Work that incorporates your VODs (as per Clause 3.d of the License).  
* Content of the Provided Copy: The License (Clause 3.d(i)) specifies that this Provided Copy *must completely include all parts within the Licensee's Published Version that incorporate your VODs*.  
* Strict Limits on Editing by Licensee: When a Licensee prepares the Provided Copy from their Published Version, any editing is *strictly limited* to the minimum extent objectively necessary to clear third-party copyrights that were present in their Published Version (e.g., muting music, removing a problematic third-party clip they had included). No other substantive or stylistic editing by the Licensee that would alter the content or presentation of the segments incorporating your VODs as they appeared in the Published Version is permitted (as per Clause 3.d(ii) of the License). This ensures the Provided Copy remains a faithful representation of their public work concerning your VODs, merely cleaned for copyright.  
* Notification of Lost Content: If these essential copyright-clearing edits by the Licensee unavoidably result in important parts of *their own original content* (like their speech) being lost or obscured in the Provided Copy, the Licensee *must* notify you of the nature and content of such lost parts, for example, by providing a textual transcript (as per Clause 3.d(iii) of the License).  
* Licensee's Warranty Applies to This "Provided Copy": Crucially, the Licensee's representation and warranty regarding the copyright cleanness of their work for your reuse (detailed in Clause 4.e.iv of the License) is specifically tied to this "Provided Copy" that they prepare and deliver to you. This means you can rely on *this specific copy* as being warranted by the Licensee as clear for your grant-back use. If you choose to reuse the Licensee's Published Version directly without requesting or using the Provided Copy, you would be doing so without the benefit of this specific warranty applying to that particular cleaned and prepared artifact.
</details>

In summary, this creates a clear choice for you as the Licensor: The grant-back license you receive (under Clause 4 of the License) applies to the Licensee's entire "Published Version." You therefore have the right to reuse any part of their publicly available work. However, the specific warranty from the Licensee that the work is "clean" for your reuse (as detailed in Clause 4.e.iv of the License) applies only to the "Provided Copy" that they prepare and deliver to you upon request.

Therefore, while the Provided Copy may be shorter than the full Published Version (as it is only legally required to contain segments that incorporate your VODs), it is the version that comes with the Licensee's explicit warranty regarding its copyright status for your reuse. If you choose to reuse parts of the Published Version directly without requesting and relying on the warranted Provided Copy, you do so without the benefit of that specific warranty from the Licensee.

<details>
<summary>A Note on the License's Design Philosophy</summary>
&nbsp;  

This detailed framework regarding the "Provided Copy" exists to provide a robust solution for various corner cases, ensuring the grant-back can function smoothly and safely when needed. However, it is important to understand that the License is designed with the expectation that you (the Licensor) can simply react directly to the Licensee's Published Version without needing to request a Provided Copy in most common cases. This allows the Licensee to create and publish their content much as they normally would, with their primary responsibility, beyond the basic conditions of the License, being to ensure their work is copyright-clean, particularly in the segments where they reuse your VODs. Crucially, this "happy path" works best precisely because the rules for the Provided Copy exist as a reliable backstop. The obligation to provide a compliant Provided Copy upon request must not become a hollow formality; the entire system functions most efficiently when Licensees are always mindful of this obligation, ensuring that even if a copy is never actually requested, the framework of accountability remains strong.
</details>

Understanding these details helps you know what to expect and what your rights are when a Licensee provides you with their Derivative Work for your grant-back purposes.

#### 3.5 Beyond Copyright: Other Legal Considerations

While the VRL provides a framework for the copyright aspects of reusing your VODs, please remember that all content creation and streaming activities – both your own and those of your Licensees – are subject to other applicable laws and third-party rights. These can include areas such as trademark, privacy, publicity rights, defamation, and unfair competition. This license does not override those other legal obligations, and compliance with all relevant laws is essential for everyone in the content creation ecosystem.


#### 3.6 The "Provided Copy" and the Spirit of Collaboration

The principle for the "Provided Copy" laid out in Clause 3.d is intended to enable you to meaningfully engage with derivative works. To achieve this, the license is built on the idea that the Provided Copy should be in a form that is reasonably modifiable.

For instance, because meaningful modification of a computer program is impossible without its source code, the license assumes that the Provided Copy for a derivative program will include its source code. For video and audio works, this principle means that if a higher-resolution or higher-bitrate version was used for editing, it is good practice to provide this master version. This allows the Licensor to create a high-quality new work. However, this does not mean the Licensee must provide the editing project file itself. If providing the project file would expose sensitive know-how such as the Licensee's unique editing techniques or plugin configurations, the Licensee is not obligated to include it as part of the Provided Copy. Providing the "editable" version of a work, whatever its format, is the ideal way to fulfill the collaborative potential of this license, allowing you to fully interact with and build upon the community's creativity.


#### 3.7 A Note on Non-Public Sharing

As a note, this license permits your licensees to share their work-in-progress non-publicly with a limited number of specific, identified production collaborators. Formal notification to you is only required prior to public publication, and the grant-back license from them applies only to the publicly published version of their work.


### 4\. A Licensee Reused Your VOD Under Your License: Initial Steps

So, a member of your community has created a Derivative Work using your VOD under your VOD Reaction License Version 0.5 and (as per Clause 3.c of the License you offer) has notified you. Here’s what you might do:

<details>
<summary>Step 4.1: Review the Licensee's Derivative Work (Their "Published Version")</summary>

* Watch their content\! See what they've created. This initial version you are reviewing is what the License refers to as the "Published Version."  
* Check if they've complied with your license terms, such as:  
  * Attribution to You: Have they correctly attributed your channel (as specified in your version of Clause 3.b of the License)?  
  * Permitted Platforms: Is their Derivative Work published on one of the platforms you designated as "Permitted Platforms" in the License (as per Clause 3.a of the License)?  
  * Check the Contracting Party: If the Licensee is a legal entity, check if their notification includes the official name of that entity, as required by Clause 3.c of the License.
* Requesting the "Provided Copy" for Grant-Back Consideration: As the Licensor, you have the right under Clause 3.d of the License to request a "Provided Copy" from the Licensee.
   * This is a standard step to consider if you wish to evaluate their work for your own grant-back reuse.
   * You might decide to request this copy for any number of reasons—perhaps you have concerns about the copyright cleanness of their "Published Version," or maybe you simply cannot access their work.
   * Your request can be simple, such as, "As per the VRL, could you please provide me with the copy of your derivative work?"
   * You are not required to explain your reasoning or instruct the Licensee on how to perform the copyright clearance; the License itself outlines their obligations for preparing this copy.
   * Finally, remember that receiving the Provided Copy simply gives you the option to reuse it; it does not create any obligation for you to actually publish content using it.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Step 4.2: Engage with the Creator</summary>

* Acknowledge their work\! A simple thank you, comment, or shout-out can go a long way in fostering a positive community.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Step 4.3: Consider Using Your Grant-Back Rights (License Clause 4)</summary>

* Remember, the License grants you (the Licensor) rights to reuse the Licensee's Derivative Work.  
* You could:  
  * Feature the Derivative Work on your own stream or in a video.  
  * Create a "reacting to reactions" segment.  
  * Use clips from the Derivative Work in a compilation or highlights reel.  
* Which Version to Reuse: For your reuse, especially if you requested it due to copyright concerns with the Published Version, you would typically use the "Provided Copy." This is because, as detailed in Clause 4.e.iv of the License, the Licensee’s warranty regarding copyright cleanness for your reuse specifically applies to this Provided Copy.
</details>

**[IMPORTANT] Prohibition on Reuse Before Receiving Notification**: The grant-back license from the Licensee (Clause 4) is only granted to you at the moment the Licensee accepts all terms of this License by providing you with notification (Clause 3.c). Therefore, you must **never reuse their Derivative Work before receiving formal notification** from the Licensee, as doing so could be considered an unlicensed use. Furthermore, if a Licensee has violated the terms and you have declared their license terminated, you must not exercise grant-back rights for any subsequent Derivative Work from that Licensee until you have formally re-licensed them via a separate agreement. Any notification they send after termination does not automatically grant a new license or new grant-back rights under these terms.

<details>
<summary>Step 4.4: If You Reuse Their Derivative Work – Your Obligations to Them</summary>

* Platform Restriction: Just like your Licensee, you must only use their Derivative Work (or derivatives you make from it, typically based on the Provided Copy if one was furnished) on the "Permitted Platforms" as defined in the License.  
* Attribution to the Licensee: You must provide attribution back to the creator of that Derivative Work.  
  * If they specified a preferred name for attribution when they notified you, use that.  
  * Otherwise, use their primary channel name.  
  * Make the attribution clear, either visually or audibly.  
* While the VRL does not specifically require you to notify the Licensee when you exercise your grant-back rights to reuse their Derivative Work, doing so can be a positive gesture.
</details>

<details>
<summary>An Optional Choice: Adopting a "Reciprocal/ShareAlike" Policy</summary>
&nbsp;  

The standard VOD Reaction License Version 0.5 does not obligate you to re-license the new works you create using the grant-back feature. This is an intentional design choice to give you, the Licensor, maximum freedom and to encourage you to engage with community content without hesitation.

However, some creators may wish to adopt a more reciprocal or "ShareAlike" philosophy. A primary motivation for this is to provide licensees with a structural "right of reply"—an explicit, license-based opportunity to create a counter-response if they feel their work has been unfairly represented—thereby fostering a truly fair and collaborative ecosystem.

You could add the following text to your channel's "About" page where you link to the License:

> "I commit to releasing any new videos I create that are based on community-made Derivative Works under the same VOD Reaction License Version 0.5."
</details>

<details>
<summary>Step 4.5: Regarding Third-Party Content in Their Derivative Work (Especially the "Provided Copy" - Corresponds to License Clauses 3.d and 4.e.iv)</summary>

* The Licensee is responsible for the copyright status of their entire Derivative Work. However, for the purpose of *your grant-back reuse*, the VOD Reaction License Version 0.5 places specific emphasis on the "Provided Copy" that the Licensee delivers to you upon request.  
* Licensee's Warranty Applies to the "Provided Copy": Clause 4.e.iv of the License states that the Licensee represents and warrants that the "Provided Copy" (as defined and prepared according to Clause 3.d of the License) is clear of third-party rights issues that would prevent your reuse under the grant-back. This is the version you should primarily rely on if copyright cleanness is a concern.  
* Nature of the "Provided Copy": Remember, Clause 3.d of the License specifies that the Provided Copy must:  
  * Completely include all parts from the Licensee's Published Version that incorporate *your* VODs.  
  * Have edits (compared to the Published Version) that are *strictly limited* to the minimum objectively necessary to clear third-party copyrights present in those parts of the Published Version. No other substantive or stylistic changes to those parts are permitted.  
  * If important original content from the Licensee (like their speech) was unavoidably lost during these copyright-clearing edits, the Licensee must notify you of this and provide details (e.g., a transcript).  
* Your Review and Caution: Even with these provisions, review the Provided Copy. If you still have concerns about third-party content within it, or if the Licensee has notified you of lost content due to necessary muting, exercise caution. Clause 4.e.iv of the License also states that the Licensee agrees to endeavor to identify or help remove/replace problematic content in the Provided Copy if you request it. Open communication with the Licensee is key if issues arise.

### 5\. Managing or Discontinuing Your License Offer

As the Licensor of your VODs under your instance of the VRL, you have the flexibility to decide which of your VODs are offered under these terms and when you might choose to discontinue offering these terms for future reuses of your VODs. To maintain clarity with your community, continuously and clearly indicating the applicable license status (e.g., "VRL applies" or "All Rights Reserved") on a per-VOD basis (such as in video descriptions) is highly desirable, especially when you are making changes to your licensing approach or managing a mix of licensed and unlicensed VODs.

#### 5.1 Stopping the Offer for Future Reuses

If you decide you no longer want to offer your VODs (or specific VODs) under the VRL for *new, future* reuses:  

<details>
<summary>Do Not Delete Your Existing License Document.</summary>
&nbsp;  

The version of the license text that applied to VODs already released under its terms is important for ongoing clarity and for those Licensees who relied on it. Do not delete this hosted document. Instead, you might:  
* Keep the existing document accessible, perhaps renaming it or clearly marking it on the document itself (e.g., adding a note like "\[ARCHIVED \- These terms applied to VODs published before \[Date of Discontinuation\] and are no longer offered for new VODs\]").  
* Ensure that links from older VODs (if they point to a specific URL for your license terms) continue to function or redirect appropriately to these archived terms if technically feasible. If not, ensure you can provide these historical terms if requested.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>Update Your General Channel Information.</summary>

* Modify any general statements on your channel (e.g., Twitch "About," YouTube description, main licensing info page) to clearly state that the VRL is no longer being offered for VODs published after \[Date of Discontinuation\].  
* It's good practice to explain how older VODs are licensed. For example: "VODs published before \[Date of Discontinuation\] were offered under the VRL v0.5 (archived terms can be found here: \[Link to your specific, now-archived or clearly marked historical license text\]). VODs published on or after \[Date of Discontinuation\] are All Rights Reserved unless otherwise indicated."  
</details>

<details>
<summary>Mark New VODs Clearly.</summary>
&nbsp;  

Ensure any VODs published *after* your discontinuation date explicitly state their new licensing status (e.g., "© \[Your Year\] \[Your Channel Name\]. All rights reserved.").  
* Communicate the Change Broadly: Clearly announce your decision to discontinue the license offer for future VODs to your community to avoid confusion and maintain trust.  
</details>

#### 5.2 Upgrading the License Version for Previously Published VODs

From time to time, new versions of the VRL template may be released with improvements or clarifications. You might wish to offer these new terms for VODs you have already published under an older version of the License.

<details>
<summary>Here’s how to handle that correctly.</summary>

* Core Principle: You Cannot Revoke Existing Rights: The most important principle to remember is that you cannot unilaterally revoke rights that have already been granted under a specific license version. A Licensee who has already started a project using your VOD under Version 0.X is entitled to continue their use under the Version 0.X terms. You cannot force them to move to Version 0.Y.

* The Correct Approach: Dual-Licensing (or Multi-Licensing): The correct way to handle this is to offer the VOD under both the old and the new license terms, giving the community the choice. This is often called "dual-licensing." You are effectively saying, "This VOD is now available under Version 0.X OR Version 0.Y. You, the Licensee, may choose which version's terms to comply with."

How to Implement an Upgrade

1. Host the New License Text: First, ensure you have customized and hosted the new version of **the License** (e.g., Version 0.Y) at a stable, public URL.
2. Update Your VOD Indications: Go back to the location where you originally indicated that a VOD was available under the old license (e.g., the YouTube description, a pinned comment, a public spreadsheet, etc.).
3. Clearly State the New Options: Update the text to reflect the new, dual-license offer. Make sure you provide links to *both* license versions.  
   * Example Before:  

      > This VOD is available for reuse under the VRL v0.X.  
      > License Text: \[Link to your V0.X license text\]  
   * Example After:
      > This VOD is available for reuse under EITHER the VRL v0.X OR the VRL v0.Y. Licensees may choose which version's terms to comply with.  
      > License v0.X Text: \[Link to your V0.X license text\]  
      > License v0.Y Text: \[Link to your V0.Y license text\]  
4. Communicate with Your Community: It's good practice to announce this change to your community (e.g., on a stream, social media, or Discord). This helps avoid confusion and explains the benefits of the new version, encouraging them to use it for new projects.
</details>


#### 5.3 Changing Placeholder Information (e.g., Your Attribution Channel Name)

If you need to update the information you provided in the placeholders of your published VRL (for example, if your channel name used for attribution changes), it is crucial to handle this transparently and fairly.  

<details>
<summary>Communicate Proactively.</summary>
&nbsp;  

Clearly announce the change to your community, ideally in advance (e.g., on your channel, social media, or wherever you post license updates). Explain what is changing and why, if appropriate.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>Specify Effective Date.</summary>
&nbsp;  

Clearly state that the new information (e.g., new attribution name) applies only to Derivative Works created *after* a specific effective date of your announcement/update.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Respect Existing Compliant Works.</summary>
&nbsp;  

Reassure your community that Derivative Works created and published in compliance with the placeholder information that was current *at the time of their creation* will still be considered compliant. You should not retroactively demand changes (like re-attribution) for these existing works.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>Update Your Hosted License Document.</summary>
&nbsp;  

Ensure the license document you host and link to reflects the updated placeholder information and clearly indicates the date of the update or a version number for that instance of your license.
</details>


#### 5.4 Impact on Existing, Compliant Uses (Applies to All Changes to Your License Offer)

<details>
<summary>It is important to understand that stopping your offer of this license for future VODs, upgrading the license version for existing VODs, or modifying your placeholder information generally does not affect the rights of Licensees who have already begun Reusing your VODs in compliance with the license terms that were in effect before you made the change.</summary>
&nbsp;  

Public licenses, once accepted through compliant use, grant rights that are typically irrevocable by the Licensor as long as the Licensee continues to adhere to the original conditions under which they started. The VRL template's grant to the Licensee in Clause 2 explicitly includes "irrevocable (as long as the Licensee complies with all conditions of this License)," which reinforces this principle.
</details>

### 6\. Addressing Specific Scenarios and Potential Issues

Unlike many FOSS licenses where termination is typically self-executing, this license is not terminated by a violation itself; rather, termination only occurs when you, the Licensor, declare it. This gives you the flexibility to resolve issues through thorough discussion with the licensee, while also retaining the power to take firm measures through retroactive termination.

<details>
<summary>Regarding the Concept of "Discretionary Termination"</summary>
&nbsp;  

Unlike many FOSS licenses where termination is typically self-executing, this license is not terminated by a violation itself; rather, termination or other actions are only executed when you, the Licensor, declare it. More accurately, it means that at the point a violation of the license terms by the Licensee occurs, the right to "initiate the procedure to terminate the license" arises for the Licensor. Since the timing for initiating this procedure is left to the licensor, the licensor may have discussions with the licensee prior to initiating this procedure. In most cases, it is expected that the issue will be resolved through discussion alone, without initiating the procedure. If the discussion is unsuccessful and the license is terminated in accordance with the procedure defined in Clause 8, the Licensor can set the termination date to any date retroactively to the date of the violation.

Let's look at the example below:

* June 1st: A Licensee publishes a video on a non-Permitted Platform (a license violation occurs).
* June 15th: The same Licensee publishes a second, fully compliant Derivative Work.
* July 1st: The Licensor discovers the violation in the first video and sends a formal notice to the Licensee requesting correction (as per Clause 8.a). This starts a one-month "Cure Period" and provisionally suspends permissions for the video in question and for creating new works (as per Clause 8.b).
* August 1st: The Cure Period ends, but the Licensee has not corrected the issue.

At this point on August 1st, the Licensor can take the following actions based on Clause 8.c:

* Automatic and Permanent Revocation of Permission for the Infringing Content (Clause 8.c(i)): Because the issue was not cured, the license permission for the violating video published on June 1st is automatically and permanently revoked. Continuing to publish this video now constitutes copyright infringement.
* Discretionary Choice to Terminate the Entire License (Clause 8.c(ii)):
In addition to the above, the Licensor may, at their sole discretion, also decide whether to terminate the entire license agreement. At this time, they can choose when the termination takes effect:  
   * Non-retroactive termination: Declare, "As of today, August 1st, your license agreement is terminated." In this case, the second, compliant video published on June 15th was created while the license was still valid, so it can remain public.
   * Retroactive termination: Declare, "Your license shall be considered terminated retroactively to the point of the violation on June 1st." In this case, not only the video from June 1st but also the second, compliant video from June 15th are considered copyright infringement. This is because the licensee's rights were retroactively voided as of June 1st; therefore, the second video was also published without a valid license.

The discretionary nature of this license's termination clause might seem unfair at first glance. However, this model was intentionally chosen to be more flexible and constructive than the "automatic termination" found in many FOSS licenses.

* Automatic Termination is like a machine: any violation, no matter how small or unintentional, immediately and often irrevocably terminates the license. There is no room for dialogue or a second chance.
* Discretionary Termination allows for a human response: Retroactive termination is equivalent to giving the Licensor the authority to delay the effective date of termination for any period they choose. As the Licensor, a breach gives you the right to terminate, but it does not force you to. This structure empowers you to:
   * Open a Dialogue: Instead of immediate termination, you can contact a licensee about an honest mistake (like improper attribution) and give them an opportunity to correct it.
   * Choose Forgiveness: If the issue is resolved, you can simply choose not to exercise your right to terminate, allowing a good-faith community member to continue their work.

The discretionary termination clause exists to encourage discussion between the licensor and licensee in the event of a breach by the licensee before the licensor takes legal action. Unlike other FOSS licenses, this license is not immediately revoked in the event of a violation, but is designed to allow time for both parties to discuss the matter. By having a cure period, the license is designed to protect the rights of the licensee in the event that the licensor refuses to discuss the matter. The ability to apply termination retroactively should be used as a last resort in the event the licensee refuses to discuss in good faith. This power provides motivation for the licensee to actively engage in dialogue and respond to correct the problem.

Even in cases where it seems difficult to correct specific violations in a video within the Cure Period, the violations can always be easily cured by deleting the infringing Derivative Work. This ensures that the Licensee can always avoid the worst-case scenario of permanent termination of their overall license agreement. However, deleting the video does not extinguish the Licensee's liability for damages caused by the breach. If the Provided Copy reused by the Licensor contains uncleared third-party content, the Licensee will remain liable for any direct losses incurred by the Licensor as a result, even after the Licensee has deleted their own video.

It is important to note that this license agreement is concluded on a per-licensee (user) basis, not on a per-video basis. Therefore, if a licensee commits a license violation in one derivative work and the licensor declares the license terminated, that licensee loses the right to reuse all other licensed content provided by that licensor under this license, unless they obtain new permission from the licensor in the future. This point is also explicitly stated in Clause 8 of the License.

<details>
<summary>A Note on Repeat Violations</summary>
&nbsp;  

Consider a scenario where a licensee violates the license and fails to remedy the issue within the Cure Period, leading to the termination of the license. If that same licensee is later granted a new license (re-licensing) and then commits another violation, the licensor may choose to retroactively revoke the new license back to the date of the first violation under the prior agreement that the licensee failed to remedy. At first glance, this may seem like an overly harsh power of the licensor. However, the intent of this clause can be understood by viewing the act of "re-licensing" not as the start of a brand-new contract, but as an act of temporarily retracting the decision to terminate, conditioned on future good-faith compliance.

Under this interpretation, the situation is as follows:
* The right to terminate retroactively, which arose from the first violation that was not remedied, is not extinguished by the re-licensing; instead, it is held in reserve by the Licensor.
* The "re-licensing" is equivalent to a conditional pardon, which defers the exercise of this reserved right.
* When the Licensee commits another violation, it means they have broken the condition of this pardon.
* As a result, the Licensor becomes free to exercise the original right they had held in reserve.

Thus, this clause does not create a new, extraordinary power. Instead, it is a rational framework for restoring trust, which stipulates that if a second chance is squandered by the Licensee, the judgment they originally deserved can then be executed.

<details>
<summary>Strategic Advantages of the VRL Framework</summary>
&nbsp;  

The unique feature of the VRL—that the Licensor can, at their own discretion, determine whether to terminate the license and when it takes effect (including retroactively)—creates the following major strategic benefits.

1. Frames the Dispute as Breach of Contract to Avoid Fair Use Arguments: In many other public licenses (like FOSS licenses), the license terminates immediately and automatically the moment a licensee commits a violation. With this approach, because the license agreement has already terminated, any discussion about the handling of the still-public video must be conducted under general copyright law. This creates an opening for the licensee to argue that their original use was permissible under "fair use," shifting the dispute into that ambiguous legal territory.

   In contrast, under the VRL, the formation of the contract is confirmed by the single act of the licensee's notification, making the "fair use" argument largely irrelevant. Because the licensee has explicitly accepted the license terms through notification, non-compliance with the conditions set forth in Clause 3 is not just a potential copyright issue, but a clear breach of the agreement they explicitly accepted. This shifts the focus of any dispute from the ambiguous world of copyright law to the much clearer realm of contract law, providing a stronger legal foundation for the Licensor.

2. Secures Grant-Back Rights by Compelling a Contractual Choice: A significant risk in content reuse stems from the ambiguity of "fair use." A creator might use your VOD and, instead of following your license, later argue their use was permissible under fair use. If their argument succeeds, they have effectively operated outside the license agreement. The direct consequence for you is critical: because the Licensee never accepted the license terms (Clause 3.c), the crucial "grant-back" license (Clause 4) is never granted to you.

   Without that contractual grant-back, your own reuse of their new work is left legally exposed. You would be forced to argue your own, separate claim of fair use, a position that is uncertain and could fail, potentially making your "reaction-to-a-reaction" video a copyright infringement. The VRL is specifically designed to eliminate this risk. By requiring notification for acceptance (Clause 3.c), it forces a clear choice: operate under the predictable terms of this contract or be in breach. This ensures that for any compliant reuse by your community, you secure the grant-back rights upfront.

3. Ensures Grant-Back Survival upon Termination to Prevent Unintentional Infringement: If a license were to terminate immediately upon a Licensee's violation, a problem would arise if the Licensor had already reused the grant-backed work. The termination could potentially invalidate the grant-back, placing the Licensor in a position where their own published content unintentionally infringes on the Licensee's copyright.

   The VRL prevents this by ensuring that the grant-back license you received survives even if the Licensee's rights are later terminated retroactively (as guaranteed by Clause 8.e). This is an extremely important safeguard that allows you to confidently engage with community creations, secure in the knowledge that your own content will not become infringing as a result of the Licensee's actions.

4. Strengthens Position Against Unlicensed Live Stream Reuse: By publishing a VOD under this license, you can weaken a potential "fair use" claim from someone who reacts to your live stream without permission. The VRL framework explicitly designates VODs (archived recordings) as the sole content eligible for reuse under these terms. By providing a clear, official, and permissive path for reusing the content via the VOD, you define the legitimate "market" for community interaction.

   Should someone bypass this system and react to the live stream directly—an act not permitted by the license—their fair use argument becomes more difficult to sustain. A key factor in fair use analysis is the effect of the use on the potential market for the original work. By ignoring a readily available licensing channel, their unlicensed use can be framed as undermining the system you have established. This strengthened legal position is expected to serve as a powerful deterrent, discouraging unauthorized live stream reuse even without resorting to legal action.

With these benefits, you gain significant leverage and clarity, allowing you to manage your community and enforce your terms with confidence.

This mechanism, which gives the Licensor the authority to decide "from when" the termination takes effect, is a unique feature of the VRL. Unlike many public licenses (such as those for open-source software) which often favor uniform, self-executing rules, this clause is intentionally designed to give the Licensor maximum practical flexibility. It blends the strong legal standing of a principle where a breach makes the license terminable with the discretionary power needed for effective and empathetic community management.

#### 6.1 Handling Potential Non-Compliance or Rights Issues by a Licensee

The VOD Reaction License Version 0.5 aims for clarity, but misunderstandings or mistakes can occur. Clause 8 of the License states that if a Licensee fails to comply with any condition, their rights under the License become subject to termination at your discretion. This means their permission to use your VODs in their Derivative Work is no longer secure and can be revoked by you. However, this does not mean that you must immediately declare the license terminated. Open communication can often lead to a resolution.

<details>
<summary>Identify the Issue.</summary>
&nbsp;  

If you (the Licensor) become aware of a Derivative Work that appears to violate the terms of your VOD Reaction License Version 0.5, the first step is to verify the issue. Examples of non-compliance could include:  
* Publishing a video using your content without notifying you.
* Improper attribution to you.  
* Publication on a non-Permitted Platform.  
* Failure to provide a "Provided Copy" upon your request in a timely manner.
* Provision of a "Provided Copy" that does not meet the specific requirements of Clause 3.d of the License.
* Inclusion of uncleared third-party content by the Licensee in the "Provided Copy" which breaches their warranty under Clause 4.e.iv of the License.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Communicate with the Licensee.</summary>
&nbsp;  

Reach out to the Licensee. Explain your concern clearly and politely. Often, non-compliance might be due to a misunderstanding rather than malicious intent.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>Possible Resolutions (Beyond Termination and Takedown)</summary>

* Correction by Licensee: The Licensee might be able to correct the issue (e.g., fix attribution, move the content to a Permitted Platform, or re-prepare and re-submit a "Provided Copy" that meets the requirements of Clause 3.d of the License). If they do so promptly to your satisfaction, you might, at your discretion, choose to consider the matter resolved and allow continued publication or accept the corrected Provided Copy. This is often the simplest path.  
* New, Separate Agreement or Understanding: Even if the original VRL technically terminated due to the breach, alternative arrangements might be possible:  
  * Granting New, Specific Permission for the Work: The Licensor always has the discretion to allow a non-compliant Derivative Work to remain public. For instance, even if the Licensee does not fully correct their work to meet the original license terms, you (the Licensor) might decide you are fine with the work remaining public as is. In that scenario, you can grant the Licensee a new, separate permission for that specific use. This new permission would operate entirely outside the terms of the VRL that was breached and would constitute a direct, one-off agreement between you and the Licensee for that particular content.
  * For Continued Use of Content with Uncleared Third-Party Materials (Requires Consent from *All* Relevant Rights Holders): If the breach involved the Licensee including third-party copyrighted material (e.g., music, video clips not originating from your VODs) for which they did not secure the necessary rights to grant back to you for your reuse, and if the desire is for the Derivative Work to remain available *with that third-party material still included*, then any new agreement or permission would require the explicit consent not only from You (the Licensor) and the Licensee, but critically, also from the original copyright holder(s) of that embedded third-party material. Simply agreeing between You and the Licensee is insufficient if third-party rights are involved and those rights holders have not authorized the continued use by both the Licensee and potentially You (if you reuse the Derivative Work). Securing these permissions can be complex and may require direct licensing from those third-party copyright holders.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>Scenario: Licensee Does Not Provide the "Provided Copy" Upon Request</summary>
&nbsp;

If you have requested a "Provided Copy" from a Licensee under Clause 3.d and they have not provided it in a timely manner, this constitutes a breach of the license. Here is a guide to the formal resolution process detailed in Clause 8. It is recommended to use this formal process only after informal reminders have failed.

**Step 1: Send a Formal Notice of Violation**

Your first formal action is to send the Licensee a Notice of Violation as described in Clause 8.a. This notice must identify the breach (in this case, the failure to provide the copy). The sending of this notice officially starts a one-month "Cure Period" and provisionally suspends the Licensee's rights. The notice must also inform them that, effective upon its sending, the permissions granted under the VRL are provisionally suspended for two areas: (i) for the specific Derivative Work in question, and (ii) for the creation and publication of any new Derivative Works. You have the discretion to extend this Cure Period at any time by notifying the Licensee. 

**Step 2: The Cure and Confirmation Process**

The Licensee's primary responsibility during the Cure Period is to provide you with the requested copy. Clause 8.b outlines a detailed, interactive process for this:

* Optional Confirmation by Licensee: If the Licensee provides the copy and wants to be certain their cure is accepted, they can send you a Notification of Cure.
* Your Review Period: Once you receive a Notification of Cure, a 7-day clock starts for you to review it.
* Acceptance by Silence: If you do not respond within those 7 days, the cure is automatically deemed accepted, and the issue is resolved.
* Notice of Insufficiency: If you find the provided copy insufficient (e.g., incomplete, wrong format), you must send a Notice of Insufficiency back to the Licensee. This automatically gives the Licensee an additional 7 days to try again. This cycle can repeat.

**Step 3: Final Determination at the End of the Cure Period**

The license also includes a fail-safe. Regardless of whether the optional confirmation process was used, you will make a final, good-faith determination of whether the cure has been completed at the end of the overall Cure Period. This protects a Licensee who provides the correct copy but forgets to send the formal Notification of Cure.

**Step 4: Consequences of Failure to Cure**

If, after the entire Cure Period and any extensions have expired, the Licensee has still failed to provide a sufficient copy, the consequences in Clause 8.c apply:

* The license for the specific Derivative Work in question is permanently revoked. Its continued public availability now constitutes copyright infringement, for which you may issue a takedown notice to the platform.
* If you determine that their failure to cooperate is serious enough to warrant severing the entire relationship, you can choose to exercise your most powerful right under Clause 8.c(ii): terminating the entire agreement.

However, it is crucial to understand the time limit imposed by Clause 8.d ("Time Limit on Exercise of Termination Rights"). This right to terminate the entire agreement must be exercised promptly after the Cure Period ends. You are prohibited from holding this right in reserve to use it at a much later date for the same violation. Therefore, you must make a timely decision. If you choose to proceed with full termination, you would send a final notice to the Licensee, stating that you are permanently terminating the entire license agreement and specifying the retroactive effective date. This is the most significant step you can take and should be reserved for situations where the trust and collaborative relationship have irreparably broken down.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Beyond Takedowns: Strategic Content Creation as a Response to Non-Compliance</summary>
&nbsp;

When a Licensee fails to comply with the license terms, a DMCA takedown is not your only option. A more proactive and often more effective strategy is to use the non-compliance as an opportunity for content creation and community education.

Action:  

0. Ensure the Licensee has provided notification of their Derivative Work before proceeding. You do not declare the termination of their license in this path.
1. Download the Licensee's public video (the "Published Version").
2. Edit the video yourself to resolve the rights issue. Be careful to ensure that all copyrights for third-party content are cleared.
3. Create your own video reacting to their work, using your newly edited version. Explain why you had to make the edits.

The best strategy depends on your goals and the specific context of the non-compliance, but the very ability to choose this "Education Path" stems from the powerful "discretionary termination" clause (Clause 8) at the heart of the VRL. Unlike licenses with automatic termination, you are not forced into a single response when a breach occurs. You remain in full control, able to decide whether to terminate the license immediately or to leverage the situation for content and community engagement.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Financial Responsibility for Uncleared Third-Party Content in Derivative Works Used Under Grant-Back (Corresponds to License Clause 4.e.iv)</summary>

* It's important to remember that under the VOD Reaction License Version 0.5, specifically Clause 4.e.iv, your Licensee provides a representation and warranty that the "Provided Copy" (as defined and prepared according to Clause 3.d of the License) has all necessary rights cleared for your reuse under the grant-back terms.  
* This means if you (the Licensor) reuse the "Provided Copy" furnished by the Licensee and a third-party rights holder subsequently contacts you demanding usage fees or other compensation due to uncleared content within that Provided Copy, the License framework anticipates that the ultimate financial responsibility for such costs rests with the Licensee due to their breach of this specific warranty.  
* In such a scenario, you would typically need to address the third-party claim. You would then have grounds to seek reimbursement or compensation from the Licensee for the costs you incurred (such as usage fees paid, settlements, or reasonable legal expenses) based on their breach of the warranty provided in Clause 4.e.iv regarding the Provided Copy.  
* Important Note on Using the "Published Version" Directly: If you choose to reuse the Licensee's "Published Version" (the one they publicly distributed) directly, without having requested or received the specific "Provided Copy" prepared under the strict conditions of Clause 3.d, be aware that the Licensee's explicit warranty in Clause 4.e.iv is tied to the "Provided Copy." While the Licensee has general responsibilities for their public content (under Clause 3.e of the License), your strongest contractual basis for seeking reimbursement from the Licensee for *your* reuse issues under the grant-back is when relying on the warranted "Provided Copy."  
</details>

<details>
<summary>A Further Note on Good-Faith Handling</summary>
&nbsp;

As a matter of community management and good faith, if the uncleared third-party content originated from your own original VOD, you (the Licensor) should carefully consider the situation. While the License is structured to place the ultimate legal responsibility on the Licensee for the content they choose to reuse, you may decide that the most constructive and fair approach is to handle any costs related to your own initial publication and subsequent reuse yourself, given you were the original source of the material.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Your Discretion</summary>
&nbsp;

As the Licensor, the decision on how to handle non-compliance ultimately rests with you. While a breach gives you the right to terminate the license, fostering a positive and collaborative community often involves dialogue and giving creators a reasonable chance to rectify mistakes where appropriate. However, for serious, repeated, or bad-faith breaches, relying on the termination clause and requesting removal of the content might be necessary to protect your rights and the integrity of your licensing approach.

The goal is to balance the enforcement of your license terms with practical community management. Having a clear license helps set expectations, and open communication can help resolve many issues constructively. The "discretionary termination" provision in Clause 8 is specifically designed to support this balance. It gives you, the Licensor, a strong legal foundation by establishing that a breach results in termination, while simultaneously granting you the full discretion to decide if, when, and how to enforce that termination. This structure ensures you are never forced into a harsh, mechanical response, giving you the time and opportunity to first engage in a thorough discussion with the Licensee. You can then always choose a path of dialogue and constructive resolution, such as granting new, separate permissions to the Licensee after discussion.

#### 6.2 Handling Non-Compliance by the Licensor When Reusing a Licensee's Derivative Work

The VRL is built on reciprocity. Just as Licensees must adhere to the Licensor's license terms when using the Licensor's VODs, the Licensor must also adhere to the conditions of the grant-back license (Clause 4 of the Licensor's VRL) when the Licensor reuses a Licensee's Derivative Work. These conditions typically include restricting the Licensor's reuse to Permitted Platforms and, crucially, providing clear attribution to the Licensee.

<details>
<summary>What if the Licensor Fails to Comply?</summary>

* For instance, imagine the Licensor features a Licensee's Derivative Work on the Licensor's channel but forgets to include the required attribution to them as specified in Clause 4.b of the Licensor's license.  

Consequences of Non-Compliance with Grant-Back Terms</summary>

* The grant-back license the Licensor received from the Licensee (under Clause 4\) is conditional upon the Licensor's adherence to its terms (e.g., attribution, platform limits).  
* If the Licensor fails to meet these conditions, the Licensor's reuse of the Licensee's Derivative Work is technically no longer authorized *by that grant-back license*. While the grant-back license itself might not explicitly state it "terminates" in the same way a Licensee's rights under Clause 8 do for their breaches, the Licensor's use effectively falls outside the scope of the permission granted to the Licensor. The content the Licensor publishes would be treated as if it were published outside the terms of the grant-back license.  
* The Licensee retains copyright in their original contributions to their Derivative Work. If the Licensor's use is non-compliant with the grant-back terms, it could be considered an unlicensed use of their content.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>Potential Actions by the Licensee</summary>

* The Licensee could request that the Licensor correct the non-compliance (e.g., add the missing attribution).  
* They might also request that the Licensor cease using their Derivative Work or remove the portions containing their original contributions if the issue is not rectified, as the Licensor's use would not be covered by the agreed-upon license terms.  
* Alternatively, the Licensee may choose to grant the Licensor separate, individual permission for that specific reuse. This would mean that, even if the Licensor's use was not compliant with the original grant-back terms, the Licensee can allow the Licensor's video to remain publicly available as is, under terms agreed upon directly between the Licensee and Licensor, independent of the VRL.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Maintaining Trust and Reciprocity</summary>

  * It's vital for the Licensor to diligently follow the grant-back terms. This upholds the fairness and mutual respect central to the VRL model. Mistakes can happen, but promptly correcting any oversight (e.g., by adding missing attribution and acknowledging the error) is important for maintaining a positive relationship with community creators.

#### 6.3 Scenario: Licensee Non-Compliance Discovered After Licensor Reuses Derivative Work

A more complex situation can arise if a Licensee's non-compliance with the VOD Reaction License Version 0.5 is discovered *after* you (the Licensor) have already exercised your grant-back rights to reuse the Licensee's Derivative Work (e.g., by creating a "reaction to the reaction" video).

<details>
<summary>The Termination Process and Survival of Your Rights</summary>
&nbsp;

If you discover a Licensee's non-compliance after you have already reused their work, Clause 8 provides a clear process for terminating their rights while ensuring your own content remains protected. The process allows you to terminate the license in phases, starting with a notification and a Cure Period (as per Clauses 8.a-c).

Most importantly, Clause 8.e stipulates that even if you terminate the Licensee's rights (including retroactively), the grant-back license you received from them survives. This means your own "reaction to a reaction" videos are safe, and you do not need to worry about them becoming copyright infringement as a result of the Licensee's violation.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Implications for Your (the Licensor's) Content</summary>

* General Case: Because the grant-back rights survive, you are typically not required to delete or alter your own content that incorporates the (now non-compliant) Licensee's Derivative Work, *provided that your use still complies with the terms of the grant-back* (attribution to Licensee, platform restrictions) and the issue is not related to uncleared third-party rights within the Licensee's work *that you reused*.  
* Critical Consideration – Third-Party Rights Issues in the Licensee's Work You Reused: A significant issue arises if the Licensee's non-compliance involved a failure to secure necessary rights for third-party content that *they* incorporated into their Derivative Work, thereby breaching their warranty to you. The VOD Reaction License Version 0.5 (in Clause 4.e.iv) clarifies that the Licensee's specific representation and warranty regarding copyright cleanness for your reuse applies to the "Provided Copy" (as defined and prepared according to Clause 3.d of the License).  
  * If You Reused the "Provided Copy": If you requested and reused the "Provided Copy" and it turns out the Licensee breached their warranty (e.g., the Provided Copy included copyrighted music or video clips for which they didn't have sublicensable rights), then your video, by incorporating this problematic Provided Copy, may inadvertently infringe on the rights of those third parties.  
    * In such a scenario, the survival of the grant-back from the Licensee does not cure the underlying third-party rights issue. You (the Licensor) would then likely need to:  
      * Remove your video, or at least the portions containing the infringing third-party material originating from the Licensee's Provided Copy.  
      * Independently secure the necessary rights or permissions from the actual third-party rights holders to continue using that content.  
    * Crucially, because the Licensee breached their explicit warranty regarding the "Provided Copy" (Clause 4.e.iv of the License), you would have grounds to seek reimbursement or compensation from the Licensee for direct losses you incurred as a result of this breach (as also stated in Clause 4.e.iv).  
  * If You Reused the Licensee's "Published Version" Directly: If you chose to reuse the Licensee's "Published Version" (the one they publicly distributed) directly, without having requested or relied upon a "Provided Copy" prepared under the specific conditions of Clause 3.d of the License:  
    * You would be reusing a version of the work for which the Licensee's specific warranty of cleanness (as per Clause 4.e.iv, which is tied to the "Provided Copy") was not directly applicable to the artifact you chose to reuse.  
    * While the Licensee still has a general responsibility for their public content under Clause 3.e of the License, your ability to claim against the Licensee based on the *specific grant-back warranty* in Clause 4.e.iv might be different compared to if you had reused a warranted "Provided Copy."  
    * If third-party rights issues emerge from a "Published Version" you reused directly, you would still likely need to take corrective action (remove/edit your content, secure rights). Your recourse against the Licensee would then depend more on broader legal principles or their general responsibilities under Clause 3.e, rather than a breach of the specific warranty tied to a (non-existent or non-utilized) "Provided Copy."  
* It's important for you (the Licensor) to be aware of which version of the Licensee's work you are reusing and understand that your strongest protection under the Licensee's specific warranty (Clause 4.e.iv) comes when you reuse the "Provided Copy" that they have prepared and warranted according to Clauses 3.d and 4.e.iv of the License.

#### 6.4 Understanding Rights in Chain Reactions or Multi-Layered Content

The VRL primarily governs the reuse of the *original Licensor's VODs*. Complex situations can arise when reactions are made to reactions, involving multiple creators' rights. Consider the scenario below.

<details>
<summary>Scenario</summary>

* Streamer A (Original Licensor) publishes their VOD 'v' under their VRL.  
* Streamer B creates a reaction video 'w' using Streamer A's VOD 'v'. Under the terms, Streamer B grants back to Streamer A a license to reuse 'w'.  
* Streamer A then creates a new video 'x' (e.g., "reacting to Streamer B's reaction"), which incorporates parts of Streamer B's video 'w'. Crucially, let's assume Streamer A also publishes this new video 'x' under Streamer A's VRL.
* Now, what if Streamer C (an unrelated third streamer) wants to react to Streamer A's video 'x' to create their own video 'y'?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Analysis of Rights</summary>

* Streamer A's video 'x' contains:  
  * Original content from Streamer A (Streamer A's new reaction commentary, excerpts of Streamer A's original VOD 'v').  
  * Original content from Streamer B (Streamer B's commentary and original contributions from video 'w').  
* The VRL that Streamer A offers for Streamer A's original VODs (like 'v') does not automatically grant Streamer C the right to reuse the portions of video 'x' that contain *Streamer B's copyrighted material* (from 'w'). Streamer A cannot license out rights Streamer A does not own or have specific sublicensing authority for beyond Streamer A's own use under the grant-back from Streamer B.  
* Therefore, Streamer C would typically need to secure permission directly from Streamer B to reuse the parts of video 'x' that originate from Streamer B's video 'w', *unless Streamer B has also offered their video 'w' under its own separate VRL or another permissive license.*  
</details>

<details>
<summary>If Streamer B Also Uses a VRL for Their Work 'w'</summary>

* If Streamer B had published *their* video 'w' under their own instance of the VRL (or a similarly permissive license), then Streamer C *could* potentially reuse the "Streamer B" portions of video 'x' under the terms of *Streamer B's license for 'w'*.  
* In such a case, if Streamer C creates video 'y' (reacting to Streamer A's 'x'):  
  * Streamer C would need to comply with Streamer A's VRL for the parts of 'x' that are Streamer A's content (attributing Streamer A, and granting back rights to 'y' to Streamer A for Streamer A's portions).  
  * Streamer C would *also* need to comply with Streamer B's VRL for the parts of 'x' that are Streamer B's content (attributing Streamer B, and granting back rights to 'y' to Streamer B for Streamer B's portions).  
  * This means Streamer C, by creating 'y', might be granting back rights to *both* Streamer A and Streamer B concerning their respective contributions to the material Streamer C reused.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>Overarching Principle</summary>
&nbsp;

All of this assumes that any *other* third-party materials (e.g., music, clips not from Streamer A or Streamer B) within any of these videos (v, w, x, y) have been properly cleared by their respective creators for the uses involved. The VRL primarily addresses the reuse of the Licensor's own contributions.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Guidance for You (as an Adopting Licensor, similar to Streamer A in this scenario)</summary>
&nbsp;

When you create content like video 'x' (reacting to a reaction that used your VODs), it's good practice to be clear in your video 'x' description about the rights involved. You might state: *"My original commentary and reuse of my VOD 'v' in this video are covered by my VRL. For reuse of Streamer B's content featured herein (from their video 'w'), please refer to Streamer B's channel for their licensing terms regarding video 'w'."* This helps guide potential reusers like Streamer C.
</details>

### 7\. Using and Modifying This License Template

The "VOD Reaction License Version 0.5" text template (which you can find at [VOD\_REACTION\_LICENSE.md](VOD_REACTION_LICENSE.md)) is provided to help you establish a clear framework for VOD reuse for your channel. Please refer to Section 11 ("Distribution and Modification of This License Document") of the License Template itself for the precise terms under which you may copy, distribute, and modify the template text.

In summary, those terms allow you to:

<details>
<summary>Copy and Distribute Verbatim</summary>
&nbsp;

You are permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of the License Template document.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Adapt by Filling Placeholders</summary>
&nbsp;

To create *your instance* of the "VOD Reaction License Version 0.5" for your VODs, you must modify the template only by accurately filling in the clearly designated placeholder sections (e.g., \[Licensor's Primary Channel Name\], \[Your Year\], \[Licensor's Designated Channel Name for Attribution\], etc.) with your specific information. No other changes to the core legal clauses are permitted if you wish to call your license the "VOD Reaction License Version 0.5" or a confusingly similar name.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Creating a New, Different License</summary>
&nbsp;

If you wish to modify the core legal terms of the License Template (beyond the designated placeholders), the resulting document will be a new and distinct license. In such a case, you must not call your modified license the "VOD Reaction License Version 0.5" or use any name that could cause confusion with it. You should give your new license a unique name.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Regarding the document format of your customized license</summary>
&nbsp;

You may choose to present your license text in various formats (e.g., plain text, PDF, or a word processor document such as .docx) that suit your hosting and sharing preferences, instead of or in addition to Markdown. The critical aspect is that the textual content itself must accurately reproduce the License Template with only the designated placeholders modified, if you wish to call your license by that name.
</details>

This approach to the License Template text is designed to ensure that any license publicly identified as a "VOD Reaction License Version 0.5" maintains a consistent set of core terms, which benefits both Licensors and Licensees by providing predictability and clarity across the community.  

The accompanying guide documents in this repository (like this "Guide for Streamers Adopting..." and the GUIDE\_FOR\_LICENSEES.md template, if provided by the original template author) are typically offered under a more permissive license like Creative Commons CC BY-SA 4.0, allowing you to adapt them for your own community (with attribution and by sharing your adaptations under similar terms). Check the specific licensing for guide documents in the repository where you obtained this template.

### 8\. Common Misunderstandings

Because this license model has unique features, some misunderstandings may arise. This section addresses some common concerns and provides clarification.

<details>
<summary>Misunderstanding 1: "The Licensor can unilaterally terminate the license retroactively at any time, on a whim."</summary>
&nbsp;

The Facts: This is incorrect. The termination process is based on multiple steps and clear conditions designed to protect the Licensee.

* Prerequisite Condition: A Licensor can only consider terminating the agreement if a Licensee has failed to cure a specific, notified violation within a one-month Cure Period.
* Guaranteed Opportunity to Cure: The Licensee is always guaranteed a one-month period to fix the violation. The Cure Period begins when the Licensee receives the notice, so there is no risk of "missing" the notification.
* The Simple Cure: Even if a specific fix is technically difficult, the Licensee can always "cure" the violation by deleting the video in question, thereby always being able to avoid the worst-case scenario of having their entire license agreement terminated.
* Comparison with FOSS Licenses: Whereas many FOSS licenses terminate "automatically" upon any violation, the VRL model is intended to be a more humane and flexible approach that leaves room for dialogue and correction.

In conclusion, a Licensor cannot terminate the license for past works on a "whim." The exercise of this right is limited to being a last resort when a Licensee fails to take the opportunity to cure a violation.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Misunderstanding 2: "The license leaves the Licensee vulnerable to the Licensor's whims and sudden copyright strikes."</summary>
&nbsp;

The Facts: This is a critical issue that requires understanding the distinction between the protections offered by a license and the fundamental mechanics of platforms and the DMCA. The VRL provides the maximum protection possible within a licensing framework, but it cannot single-handedly fix a systemic issue.

* Part 1: The Contractual Protection Provided by the License

   As a binding legal agreement, the VRL offers significant protection. The license is "irrevocable," and in case of a violation, the Licensor is contractually obligated to provide a "Notice of Violation" and a one-month "Cure Period." A Licensor who ignores this procedure and issues a strike is in breach of their own contract. This is the powerful legal high ground the license provides to the Licensee.

* Part 2: The Sobering Reality of Platform Enforcement (A DMCA Issue, Not a VRL Issue)

   It is true that a malicious Licensor could still attempt a wrongful takedown, and the platform may initially act on it. This, however, is not a flaw in the VRL itself, but a fundamental issue with how the DMCA takedown process is implemented by platforms.

   * This is a Universal Problem: Platforms are not equipped to act as judges in complex contractual disputes between users. To maintain their "safe harbor" status, their systems are designed to respond to takedown requests quickly. This risk of a wrongful takedown exists for all creators on the platform, regardless of what license they use, or even if they use no license at all.

   * The VRL is the Best Possible Defense: Given this systemic reality, the VRL provides the strongest possible protection a license can offer. Instead of a subjective "fair use" debate, the VRL provides the Licensee with irrefutable, contractual evidence that they have permission. This makes a malicious takedown claim legally indefensible. While no license can prevent someone from abusing the platform's reporting system, the VRL ensures you have the best possible ammunition to win the ensuing dispute.

In conclusion, the problem of wrongful takedowns is inherent to the platform and DMCA system. The VRL cannot change that system, but it provides the maximum protection possible within that system's constraints, transforming a potential legal gray area into a clear-cut case in your favor.

It should be also noted that if a Licensor is extremely malicious, the possibility of them colluding with a third party to have that third party issue a copyright strike against the Licensee may still exist.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Misunderstanding 3: "This is a one-sided (asymmetrical) license that only benefits the Licensor."</summary>
&nbsp;

The Facts: This license is designed for a balanced, "reciprocal exchange" to ensure both the Licensor's creative drive and the community's health are maintained.

* On Additional Restrictions (Clause 3.f): The additional rules a Licensor can set are not unlimited. They are strictly limited to two areas: (i) rules about the permissibility of commercial use, and (ii) conditions regarding the Derivative Work itself (such as brand safety). A Licensor cannot use this clause to demand payment or social media follows.
* On the Symmetry of the Grant-Back (Clause 4): The Grant-Back is the "consideration" that the Licensee provides in exchange for the right to use the VOD. This grant-back is not a blank check; when exercising it, the Licensor is bound by many of the same obligations as the Licensee:
   * The Licensor is obligated to provide Attribution (credit) to the Licensee.
   * The Licensor may also only use the work on the Permitted Platforms.
* On the Asymmetry of Choice: The Licensee has the freedom to choose which Licensor's content to use. In contrast, the Licensor, by offering a public license, cannot pre-select who their Licensees will be. In addition, the number of licensees could be large for a single licensor, in which case the licensor's position becomes weaker than that of the licensees as a whole.

In conclusion, the Licensor provides the "Content," and in return, the Licensee provides "Credit and the Grant-Back." Rights and obligations are set for both parties, and the structure does not create a one-sided relationship.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Misunderstanding 4: "The Licensor can use retroactive termination to delete any past videos they don't like."</summary>
&nbsp;

The Facts: "Retroactive termination" is a limited right that can only be exercised under specific conditions.

* Limited Activation Condition: To reiterate, this right can only be considered if a Licensee fails to cure a violation within the Cure Period.
* Time Limit on Exercise: Furthermore, Clause 8.d explicitly prohibits the Licensor from holding this right in reserve indefinitely to use it later on a "whim." After the Cure Period expires, the Licensor must decide whether to exercise the right "promptly."
* Purpose: The purpose of this clause is not to delete videos that the Licensor dislikes. It is a logical consequence for a breach of contract, designed to invalidate the license for other videos that were created after the initial, uncured violation, by a Licensee who has demonstrated an unwillingness to comply. With many other FOSS licenses, the license terminates automatically at the first violation; therefore, the VRL's retroactive termination is not a stricter measure than those licenses.

In conclusion, "retroactive termination" is not targeted at sincere licensees; it is a limited and final measure against a party deemed unwilling to comply with the rules of the license.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Misunderstanding 5: "This license creates a double standard regarding 'Fair Use'."</summary>
&nbsp;

The Facts: This is a misunderstanding of how specific licenses (like the VRL) and general legal doctrines (like "Fair Use") interact. The VRL is designed to create a clear and safe option in addition to fair use, not to replace it or create a conflict. This principle applies to everyone.

* Part 1: Why it's not a "double standard."
  The core concern is whether it's hypocritical to use this license. For example:

   * A Licensee fears they can't use fair use on other channels after accepting the VRL.
   * A Licensor is criticized for using fair use on others' content while demanding others follow their VRL.

   The explanation for both is the same: the guiding principle is to respect the rules of each individual "venue."

   * The VRL is a specific, voluntary "opt-in" agreement. By accepting it with Licensor A, a Licensee is simply following the clear rules for that venue. It does not affect their ability to interact with Creator B, who has no such rules.
   * When a Licensor (or Licensee) encounters content with no special license, the only rules that apply are the general ones provided by copyright law. Relying on "fair use" in this context is not a double standard; it is consistently applying the correct rule for each situation.

* Part 2: How Licensing Conditions Affect a 'Fair Use' Analysis.
The existence and type of a license do not eliminate "fair use," but they provide crucial context for whether a use is likely to be considered "fair." Here is a breakdown of common scenarios:

   * Case A: No License Specified (The Ambiguous Default)
   When a video is uploaded with no explicit license terms, a reuser must rely entirely on a standard "fair use" analysis. The argument depends on the transformative nature of the new work (commentary, criticism, parody, etc.). This is the most common but also the most legally uncertain situation.

   * Case B: Standard Platform Licenses (e.g., the 'Standard YouTube License')
   This license grants users permission for basic platform functions like viewing and sharing via the official embed player. It does not grant permission to download the content to create a new, derivative work. Because permission for such a use is explicitly not granted by the license, a reuser must justify their actions under the separate legal principle of fair use. The license's existence clarifies the default permissions, but it does not legally prevent a fair use defense for uses outside those permissions.

   * Case C: Explicitly Restrictive Licenses (e.g., "All Rights Reserved," "Do Not Re-upload")
   When a creator explicitly forbids reuse, a fair use claim becomes more difficult, though not legally impossible. Such a statement clearly signals the creator's intent to control the market for their work. A court may be less sympathetic to a use that directly defies the creator's explicit wishes, which can negatively impact a fair use analysis.

   * Case D: Permissive Licenses (e.g., a VRL or Creative Commons)
   This is the clearest situation. These licenses offer a guaranteed "safe harbor" for reuse if the terms are followed. If a reuser chooses to ignore the simple, offered terms (e.g., by forgetting attribution) and then tries to claim fair use, their argument will be significantly weakened. A court would likely question why the reuser did not follow the reasonable and explicit path of permission that was provided.
