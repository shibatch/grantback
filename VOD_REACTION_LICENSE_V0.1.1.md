You MAY list multiple platforms. When choosing and listing platforms, you are responsible for making a reasonable effort to ensure their Terms of Service (ToS) do not conflict with this VOD Reaction License and that the platform(s) can support this License's requirements (e.g., displaying attribution, public access to content).

a. Platform Restriction for Licensor:  
The Licensor's use of such Streamed Work is restricted to the Permitted Platforms. The Licensor may only publish, share, or make such Streamed Work (or derivatives thereof created by the Licensor from such Streamed Work) available on these platforms.

When using such Streamed Work, the Licensor must provide attribution to the Licensee. This means the Licensor will clearly display the Licensee's primary channel name (e.g., the Licensee's Twitch or YouTube channel name, whichever is primarily associated with such Streamed Work, or as the Licensee may otherwise instruct the Licensor in writing) in text on screen OR clearly announce it audibly within any new work created by the Licensor that incorporates such Streamed Work. The method of attribution shall be reasonable for the medium used by the Licensor.

The Licensor may feature such Streamed Work on the Licensor's own channels on the Permitted Platforms, including during collaborative streams or videos with other creators appearing on the Licensor's channel(s) as guests or co-hosts.  
However, if such Streamed Work is to be primarily or independently broadcast or published by a collaborator on a channel not operated by the Licensor as part of a collaboration authorized by the Licensor, the Licensee's prior explicit approval for such specific use by that collaborator is required.

d. Sublicensing by Licensor:  
The Licensor may grant necessary sublicenses to the operators of the Permitted Platforms (as per their respective Terms of Service) to the extent required to host, display, and enable platform features for such Streamed Work when featured on the Licensor's channels or for collaborative broadcasts conducted in accordance with Section 4.c.

(iii) All rights in the Licensee's Streamed Work not expressly granted back to the Licensor under this Section 4 are reserved by the Licensee.

(iv) The Licensee represents and warrants that the Licensee has obtained all necessary rights, licenses, consents, and permissions for all content (including the Licensee's original contributions and any third-party content the Licensee incorporated) within the Licensee's Streamed Work to grant the full scope of the license to the Licensor as described in this Section 4, free of any encumbrances or restrictions that would prevent the Licensor's exercise of such rights. The Licensee agrees that if any third-party content the Licensee included in the Licensee's Streamed Work is not clear for the Licensor's reuse under this grant-back, the Licensee will, upon request, endeavor to identify such content to the Licensor or take reasonable steps to remove or replace it to enable the Licensor's use. The Licensor's use of the Licensee's Streamed Work is reliant on these representations.

5\. Reservation of Rights and Third-Party Content in Original VODs

All rights in the VODs not expressly granted by the Licensor in this license are hereby reserved by the Licensor. To the best of the Licensor's knowledge, the original content created by the Licensor within the VODs does not infringe upon the copyrights of third parties. This license grants rights only to such original content created by the Licensor. This license does not grant the Licensee any rights to use third-party copyrighted content that may be incidentally included in the VODs (e.g., in-game music, other's video clips, copyrighted music played during the stream). If the Licensee chooses to Reuse portions of the VODs that include such third-party content, the Licensee is solely responsible for determining if its use is permissible (e.g., under fair use doctrines or other exceptions) and for obtaining any necessary permissions from the respective rights holders of that third-party content. The Licensor makes no further warranties and assumes no liability regarding the clearance or suitability of any third-party content within the VODs for the Licensee's Reuse.

6\. Warranty Disclaimer

The VODs are provided "AS-IS" without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. The Licensor disclaims all warranties, including but not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. The Licensee uses the VODs at the Licensee's own risk.

7\. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall the Licensor be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption) however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the use or inability to use the VODs, even if advised of the possibility of such damage.

8\. Term and Termination

This license is effective as long as the Licensee complies with its terms. If the Licensee fails to comply with any condition, the Licensee's rights under this license terminate automatically. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10 shall survive any termination of this license.

9\. Excusable Non-Performance

Neither party shall be held liable for any failure or delay in performing any of its obligations under this License if such failure or delay (a) is caused by circumstances genuinely beyond its reasonable control, (b) occurs without its fault or negligence, and (c) could not have been prevented by reasonable precautions. Such circumstances may include, without limitation, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, epidemics, pandemics, or significant and widespread failures of essential third-party services or infrastructure (such as internet, power, or Permitted Platform outages) not caused by the party claiming excuse. The party affected by such circumstances shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of the non-performance and to resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable.

10\. General Provisions

If any provision of this license is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
